As with self-degradation for Life 3 Degrading the Form, but turned on another. The mage can lower one dot per success up to a maximum amount equal to his Life dots. The mage must first grab hold of or touch the target; roll Strength or Dexterity + Brawl - the target's Defense. If that's successful, the mage can cast this spell as an instant action in the following turn. (With Life 5, he can cast it at sensory range as an instant action. He needs Life 6 before he can add Space 2 for a sympathetic casting.) Note: Lowering Strength or Dexterity also lowers the target's Speed and Initiative, and might affect Defense, while lowering Stamina also lowers Health.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Weaken The Foe","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Strength","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","RoteDicePool_Resisted":"Stamina","roteDescription":"The threat posed by an enemy incapable of holding a weapon is much less than that of one at full strength. Adamantine Arrow willworkers cast this rote to debilitate foes, whether in combat or for some other reason (perhaps rendering them less agile while she pursues over treacherous ground, or less hardy during frigid weather). Silver Ladder mages use their own version of this magic (Presence + Intimidation + Life) to whittle away the physical prowess of opponents."}]}
