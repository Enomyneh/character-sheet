He can attack the Pattern of a spell, destroying it by pulling apart the threads that comprise it. At this level, the mage does not need to have any dots in the Arcana used in the magic to be dispelled. His Prime lore is enough to unweave any spell. This effect works like Dispel Magic, but the mage does not need to posses all the Arcana involved.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Undo The Art","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","RoteDicePool_Contested":"target spell's Potency","roteDescription":"Free Council mages use this rote to dissipate the magics of enemies, rivals, and sometimes people who need a lesson in humility.
