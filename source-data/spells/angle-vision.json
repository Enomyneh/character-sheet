His vision shifts as if he'd changed his vantage point to look around the blockage. With Space 1, the spell can be used to direct the mage's sight around a single corner or obstacle, as long as the new vantage point is one that's within reach of some part of his body. He could hold a newspaper in front of his face, for example, and see over the top of it as if he'd craned his neck. With Space 2, the mage can send his vision off like a mobile camera, around multiple, distant obstacles or through a series of twists and turns, like the bends of a ventilation shaft. The spell doesn't magnify or illuminate whatever's at the far end of his vision, it just provides him with an unobstructed view. This use of the spell requires the caster to concentrate for the duration of the casting.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"The Crooked Eye","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"While this rote helps a Guardian to see what might otherwise be hidden, it's also useful for disguising her intent. When the rote is active, no one can be certain exactly what the mage is looking at or where she's directing her attention. She may seem to have her head stuck in a paperback novel when she actually has a clear view of what's happening on the other side of the book."}]}
