Its weight stays the same, but its volume is reduced accordingly, allowing it to be folded like paper. The mage essentially shunts most of the object's mass into an extra-dimensional space, turning the object into a silhouette of itself. Though the object loses neither weight nor Structure points, the object's physical properties are altered, making it bendable and foldable. For each success, the mage can affect five cubic feet of solid matter. The mage can reflexively restore the object to its full volume at any time. The affected item returns to its full volume instantly when the spell expires; anyone standing nearby may be subject to Knockdown.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Pack Up Your Troubles","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"It's said that this rote was created by an Arrow master who liked his apprentices to stow their gear as efficiently as possible. It's not only a way to fit lots of gear in a small space, it enables Arrows who need to appear unarmed to pack a hidden weapon or two... just in case."}]}
