Linen clothes become silk, decades-old cars become this year's model, old black and white televisions become plasma screens and personal cassette players become mp3 players. The object being transformed must retain the same basic function and description (\"a chair,\" \"a car\" and so on, but the new expression of that description and function are up to the casting mage. The new form may (and frequently does) include precious substances. The efficiency in terms of equipment modifiers of the object is not affected, so the spell is often cast combined with Alter Efficiency. At this level, the mage must touch the targeted object. With Matter 5, he can cast the spell at sensory range.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"Midas Touch","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult or Science","roteDescription":"Alter Efficiency is all well and good for getting uncommon results out of ordinary looking objects, but the Ministry of Mammon has a liking for objects that look and feel as good -- or better -- than they are. Seers of the Ministry use this rote to keep themselves in the luxury to which they are accustomed, updating their possessions to this year's fads and always having the latest designer gadget that does the same thing as last year's model."}]}
