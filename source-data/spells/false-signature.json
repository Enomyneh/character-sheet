The ability to change the signature of a spell, making it appear to originate from a different Arcanum, can give the caster a psychological edge during magical combat. A Forces rote cast with the arcane signature of Time can make an opponent second guess the mage's abilities and can act as a foil to countermagic. Mages using Mage Sight are allowed a reflexive Wits + Occult roll to notice the true nature of a spell's Arcanum. Targets suffer a -1 penalty to this roll per point of Potency of the altered spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Feint","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"Many mages have been wrong-footed by an Arrow through use of this spell. Some mages, anticipating a direct attack, see what they expect to see and are surprised when a Forces spell has a more subtle effect. Use of this rote can also conceal order-specific mystical secrets. It's hard to copy a rote when a mage can't be sure about the Arcanum involved."}]}
