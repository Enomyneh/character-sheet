Fear distorts spatial perception, just as it distorts the perception of time, influencing shooters' aim. A mage who casts this spell is not guaranteed to be any less afraid during a gunfight, but she does have a much more accurate sense of where everyone and everything is. The spell creates a mental spatial map that constantly updates the mage on the changing topography of her surroundings, from the guy with the shotgun sneaking up among the parked cars, to the stray leaf blowing by in that sudden breeze.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Ballistic Targeting","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Arrow mages who learn this rote can be crack shots during a blizzard in the middle of the night (or at least not have whatever prowess they naturally possess suffer for adverse conditions).
