For example, a car just won't work right (when it works at all), or an enraged wife murders her spouse with an unlucky paperweight. On the turn after casting, the targeted object is subject to an equipment dice penalty equal to the spell's successes, up to a maximum of the caster's Fate dots. In addition, a suit of armor's protection can be decreased by one point per success (even down to zero points). As a roleplaying consideration, unlucky objects tend to cause their owners harm (an unlucky carving knife cuts a chef's hand, putting him out of action for weeks). Sometimes (as in the case of the cursed paperweight, above) an unlucky object need not even be used by its owner to bring ill fortune upon him.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Sword Of Damocles","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult or Science","roteDescription":"Adamantine Arrow willworkers use this rote to curse their enemies' armaments with ill luck.
