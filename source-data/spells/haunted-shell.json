The targeted ghost enters the object to which it is bound as though the object were an anchor, save that the ghost continues to be aware of its surroundings and capable of using its Numina. The object Durability becomes the Resistance of the ghost, if the ghost's Resistance is higher than its original Durability. In objects capable of moving and taking actions, all rolls use the ghost's normal attributes. The item must in some way contain or incorporate one of the ghost's anchors or be located in a place that is the ghost's anchor.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
