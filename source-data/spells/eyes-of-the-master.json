These masters feel the need to constantly mentally eavesdrop on their students. This spell allows the master to forge a long-term telepathic link with the recipient. While this spell does not require a formal mentor-student relationship, forging the necessary deep psychic connection to someone does require the subject's willing participation. For the duration of the spell, the caster can perceive anything the target senses with her five mundane senses. The spell's Duration is prolonged, but it requires concentration for the caster to actively \"ride\" the target. This spell is often cast with advanced prolongation (requiring Mind 4), so that the rider can keep track of the target for a long period of time. This spell is sometimes cast in combination with Mind 3 Telepathy, allowing the mage to also speak to the spell's recipient across distances.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Horse And Rider","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Empathy","roteDescription":"This rote goes back to just after the Fall. Afraid for their own safety, the Guardians of the Veil would send junior mages on errands for their masters, remaining in telepathic communication. This spell would frequently be supplemented by the Mind 3 Mental Wall spell, giving the \"horse\" a mental barrier for everything except the mental link."}]}
