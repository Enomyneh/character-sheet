Some mages learn to occlude their own pasts and futures from others' scrutiny, but simple concealment isn't always sufficient; sometimes, deception is called for. Under these sorts of circumstances, mages skilled in Time's magic can fabricate events in history or yet to come, deliberately leading enemies astray. For this spell's Duration, the caster's history and future reflect whatever she wishes when glimpsed by anyone using prophecy, divination or any other form of temporal Scrying to read either, unless the caster overcomes the Potency of this spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"Lie To Yesterday And Tomorrow","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"Few things are as precious as one's history and future, particularly to Seers of the Throne who have pursued the mysteries of the Time Arcanum. With magic such as this, however, an enterprising servant of the Throne can skew an enemy's temporal perceptions when he turns them on her, allowing her to reflect whatever past or future she wishes."}]}
