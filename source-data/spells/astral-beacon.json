The caster marks the location with a specific emotional \"signature.\" Once the caster transmits this signature to another individual using Voice From Afar (or another Mind spell that transmits emotions), that individual can travel to the desired astral location once she visits its particular Astral plane (Oneiros, Temenos, or Dreamtime). The target number depends on the \"depth\" of the Astral plane in which the beacon is set. Following the beacon, the Astral traveler can instantly reach the marked location after reaching the correct plane, unless an Astral entity (or other mage) specifically bars direct access. Such is the case with certain Astral entities, who do not want mages to breach their homes without following the proper protocols. If the Astral location disappears (as is often the case in dreams), the spell ends.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
