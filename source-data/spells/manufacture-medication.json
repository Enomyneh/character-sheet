To be instilled in medication, a spell must act on its user's organic biology, healing him or bolstering his Physical Traits. (Sensory spells are imprinted in drops, another form of gross material.) Pills are swallowed, and take effect after a time delay based on the user's Stamina. By scoring additional successes during the creation process, the alchemist may exactly specify the length of delay between ingestion and effect, regardless of the user's Stamina. The greater the number of successes, the longer the maximum possible delay. The delay is fixed during manufacture. Intravenous drugs are injected via hypodermic needles or easy-to-use auto-injectors, such as the pen-like devices used to rapidly deliver adrenaline to victims of anaphylactic shock. These drugs take effect in one turn, regardless of the user's Stamina. Hardened IV drug users may find it difficult or impossible to find usable veins to inject alchemical serums into.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
