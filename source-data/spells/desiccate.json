The caster cannot increase his pool beyond the maximum he can have (for example, an individual with a Strength 3 can only increase his Strength to 5 and cannot exceed the amount of Mana he can hold according to his Gnosis rating). Similar to the spell Siphon Mana (Prime 5), successive castings against the same target within the same scene suffer a cumulative -2 dice penalty. If an Attribute or Health is reduced to 0, the caster has the option of returning a portion of the siphoned energy to bring the Attribute or Health rating up to 1. Otherwise, the victim dies. An Awakened target can attempt to resist through a contested roll: Willpower versus the caster's successes. A Sleeper has no defense unless otherwise protected by a mage. Protective spells apply.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Weaken The Alien","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The Translator version of this spell, used by Morris, is intended to keep any aliens or suspected aliens (or even alien sympathizers) from operating at their full capacity and posing a threat to the Banishers during questioning and up to the time of \"translation.\""}],"notes":"There is no listed duration, however the effects should be lasting."}
