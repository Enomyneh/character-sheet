In addition, he gives it a semi-substantial form so that it can touch things and even provide a weak barrier. The mage creates a one-yard radius patch of darkness or five-cubic yard volume of darkness. Each success gives the shadow Strength 1 (used to lift objects) or Durability 1. It is not a material object, so it has no Structure. Attacks directed through it (if it is being used for cover) must deal with its Durability, but they don't damage the shadow barrier.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Child Of Midnight","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"By conjuring up such impenetrable and even animate shadows from light, a Free Council mage can create a barrier that serves as cover against ranged weapon attacks, he can conjure a specter to frighten off an intruder, or he can wield a battering ram to fell a door."}]}
