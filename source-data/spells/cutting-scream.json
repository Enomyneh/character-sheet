Each success on the casting roll inflicts one point of bashing Health damage. With Forces 4, damage dealt may be improved to lethal, or by spending one Mana with Forces 5, damage dealt may be improved to aggravated. This spell is treated as a ranged attack, fired at melee range, allowing the target their normal Defense. The volume of the sonic attack is loud enough to temporarily deafen opponents. For each point of damage taken, the target is deafened for one turn, but is allowed a reflexive Stamina check to reduce the number of turns deafened by one per success. Deafened mages gain no bonus to spell casting from chanting in High Speech.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Battle Cry","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Arrows who prefer to get up close and personal in combat favor this rote. The close range blast of sound is difficult to avoid and deals satisfactory damage. The secondary deafening effect is also useful in reducing the ability of multiple opponents to coordinate their attacks."}]}
