A simple success affects gravity in a one-yard radius. Excess successes spread the energy over a larger area. Characters who fall into objects take damage normally. A person in the radius who is sent \"falling\" upward travels at the same rate as someone falling downward, but once he exits the radius affected, he is subject to normal gravity again. Although his momentum might still send him upward for a turn or two, the natural downward pull of gravity brings him back down -- unless he falls into the radius of the altered gravity, which sends him upward again. He might oscillate between the area of altered gravity and normal gravity until the spell expires.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium","roteName":"Upending Expectations","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult or Science","roteDescription":"With this rote, a Mysterium mage can reach places normally inaccessible to her, or suddenly cause an entire roomful of assailants to “fall”upward and hit the ceiling. Adamantine Arrow mages use their own version of this magic (Composure + Occult + Forces) to seize the advantage in combat."}]}
