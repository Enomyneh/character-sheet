Those nearest the mage suffer the most damage, as the wave of force quickly decreases in ferocity the further the wave spreads. The visible effects from this spell on a body are misleading. Serious internal damage can be caused while leaving only bruises. This spell causes damage based on target proximity from point of origin (the caster). All targets within a one-yard radius of the mage suffer one point of lethal Health damage per success on the casting roll. All targets outside the one-yard radius, but within three yards of the mage, suffer one point of bashing Health damage per success on the casting roll. Damage dealt is considered Resistant Damage, and in the case of multiple targets, subtract the highest Stamina present from the casting roll. It is possible to exclude friendly targets from Kinetic Ripple by including Fate 2 in the spellcasting.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Break The Line","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"The Adamantine Arrow uses this spell to disrupt enemy lines and to scatter clumped groups.
