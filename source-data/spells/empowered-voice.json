With this spell, a mage can move from one scenario to the other instantly, as her voice is transformed from a tool of communication into a potent weapon. A single syllable uttered by the mage is magically amplified, creating a thunderous shockwave to sweep aside any who would stand in her way. The mage utters any brief word or syllable, which instantly becomes a deafening thunderclap. Anyone within the affected area, a one-yard radius centered on the mage, is subject to a Knockdown effect: They must roll Dexterity + Athletics to remain on their feet. Characters knocked to the ground lose their next action as they regain their footing. Dramatic failure indicates that the victim takes a hard fall and suffers a point of bashing damage as well. The mage may use the spell's extra successes to contest the targets' Knockdown rolls, or may use them to extend the area of effect, with each extra success doubling the area (a two-yard radius with two successes, a four-yard radius with three successes and so on). She must apply that choice to all targets, though: Her success either makes the sound louder, or makes it travel farther.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Thunderword","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"\"Speak loudly and carry a big stick\" is a philosophy many Arrow mages can relate to.
