He can also detect their unseen presence, if they are hiding or have chosen not to reveal themselves. He can see spirits within Twilight, too, but they appear hazy and indistinct and he cannot hear them, unless he also uses Spirit 1 while casting this spell. He cannot perceive mental projections unless he adds Mind 1 to the casting.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Song Of Orpheus","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"As Orpheus' music could move even the dead to weep and speak with him, the mage using this rote calls upon that precedent to compel the dead to speak with him. The Imago incorporates the use of stringed music, and the spell itself is augmented if the mage plays the Imago's tune on a stringed instrument while he casts. Factor Bonuses: Playing stringed instrument (factor bonus equal to equipment bonus)."}],"notes":"Spirit and Mind have been added as optional arcana based on the text in the description."}
