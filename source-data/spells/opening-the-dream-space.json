At Mind 5, the mage can cast this spell on behalf of another -- opening an unwilling person's mind to someone else; when used this way, additional Target factors can increase the number of minds opened or the number of people allowed into a single mind.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Oneiros Intrusion","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"People hide their greatest secrets -- even some from themselves -- in their subconscious.
