He senses when others nearby use exceptional mental powers, such as telepathy, psychometry or ESP, reading the telltale ripples left by the movements of exceptionally advanced thought. The mage can also read resonance, discerning the emotional and psychic qualities of it: The particular nuances of will, conscious or otherwise that went into creating it. He can feel the mental processes that went into creating the resonance (such as strong emotional states or a powerful exercise of will), effectively detecting its context within reality, the \"why\" behind the resonance. See the information on Resonance for rules on scrutinizing magic with this spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Theosophy Tradition Rote","roteName":"Ajna","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The mage meditates for a time, closing his eyes and focuses his being on the center of his forehead.
