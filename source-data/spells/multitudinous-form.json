Like the Life 5 spell Greater Shapechanging, the caster of this rote changes form without the possibility of becoming lost in his new shape. While in the shape of the swarm, the mass of the insects must stay within a 10-foot area of each other or the spell will unravel. In combat situations, the swarm suffers little damage from conventional weaponry. Against stabbing, shooting, or bashing types of attacks, the swarm is considered to have Armor 10 and any wounds suffered (regardless of source) are considered bashing. Only weapons that deal area damage (grenades, explosives, fire) have any chance of causing significant damage to the mage-swarm. Weapons of the area-effect variety deal normal damage for their type. The swarm has equal Health to that of the caster. Offensively, attacks by the swarm ignore any mundane Defense or Armor ratings of living targets. The caster rolls Intelligence + Animal Ken + Gnosis for each attack, dealing 1 bashing damage per success.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Tablets Of U'mat Rote","roteName":"Multitudinous Form","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Animal Ken or Survival","roteDescription":"This rote is performed just as the spell, above."}]}
