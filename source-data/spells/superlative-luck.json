The mage gains the 8-again quality (reroll results of 8, 9 and 10) on one future dice roll per success achieved in the spellcasting roll. The player can choose which of his rolls are affected by this superlative luck, and they can involve any action or task. This effect lasts for one scene (unless additional Duration factors are added during casting), after which time any unused luck rolls are lost. Note that this spell does not affect a chance die, should a mage's dice pool be reduced to one. Only a result of 10 is a success.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Walking The Supernal Path","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Like any other thing, Fate can be bent to the needs of a superior will.
