This spell can be used to speak or whistle in ranges completely foreign to the human larynx. A mage can get the attention of dogs and other creatures that can hear in different pitches. Some myths suggest that a good, loud whistle pitched above the human range of sound could startle (and thus reveal) unprepared supernatural creatures who might otherwise successfully masquerade as human. Use is not limited to sounds the mage creates herself. She may alter the frequency of any sound within sensory range for the duration, for whatever purpose she desires. Using this spell on others' voices, or on other sounds that Sleepers expect to recognize, is a good way to make it Improbable.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Secret Whispers","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Some secrets are too sensitive to be spoken, but too important not to be recorded or shared with another trustworthy Guardian. When this is the case, the Guardians of the Veil may use their magic to narrow the field of who can eavesdrop. One Guardian uses this rote while another casts Forces 1 Receiver, enabling the first to speak in a tone no human (or unprepared mage) will understand while the second listens. Being observed talking without sound is suspicious, so some mages utilize recording devices. Some record their altered voices (in which case they must be sure that the device can capture that range) and use them as personal journals, from which others will only hear static. Used to communicate, the altered voice can be played while the mage makes filler conversation, and the second mage listens to the recording. This is more secure than the alternative, which involves recording normal sound and altering the recording as it plays back."}]}
