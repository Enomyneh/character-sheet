A common cold might require one success while Ebola might require eight or more. The mage must mimic an existing disease, and the more virulent or easily transmitted it is, the more successes it requires. The disease is contagious; anyone can potentially catch it after exposure (a reflexive Stamina + Athletics or Survival roll might stave it off).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Interdiction","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","roteDescription":"Guardians occasionally use this rote to end a threat to the secrecy of the Mysteries in a way that raises few suspicions. After all, a noted journalist  who suddenly disappears raises questions, while a fatal or even just crippling illness is dismissed by most as nothing more than bad luck. Free Council mages experimenting with microbial life and the like occasionally use a variant rote (Intelligence + Medicine + Life)."}]}
