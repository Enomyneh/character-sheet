This spell may only be cast after the mage has suffered at least one point of bashing, lethal, or aggravated damage. The spell works only in the turbulent emotional aftermath of a genuine accident or attack by hostile others. The appropriate mental state can never be provoked by incidents of self-harm, or harm inflicted by one's confederates. However, a qualifying incident may be engineered by provoking one's enemies. The spell is performed after the conclusion of the violent incident, before the mage seeks medical attention, pain relief or other healing. During the spell's casting, the willworker uses a knife or similar implement to self-inflict up to three additional points of lethal damage. For each point suffered in this manner, the mage adds one to a pool of points known as a Pain Harvest pool. Only the self-inflicted damage contributes to the Pain Harvest pool. The mage may at any subsequent time relinquish control over an imbued spell, curse, enhancement or defense installed in an Enchanted Item, by paying 12 points from her Pain Harvest pool.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Contracted In Sinew","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Survival","roteDescription":"For Adamantine Arrow warriors, getting wounded is an everyday occurrence, affording frequent opportunities to top up their Pain Harvest pools.
