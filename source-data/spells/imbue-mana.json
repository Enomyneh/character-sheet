The mage gives a living creature one of his Mana points per success. The caster must touch the target during casting (with Prime 4, he can affect the subject at sensory range). If combined with Channel Mana or Siphon Mana, the mage can take Mana from one source (other than himself) to give to another. Channeling Mana into a living being usually does nothing to it (save perhaps for a feeling of being energetic or edgy) unless the subject is Awakened, in which case she adds the Mana to her total. If the number of points of Mana invested in a Sleeper's Pattern exceeds her Size, the subject suffers one Health wound of bashing damage per point of Mana by which her Size is exceeded, as the celestial fire literally tears her Pattern apart like an over-inflated balloon rupturing. In this case, the target can resist the spell by subtracting her Stamina from the caster's roll.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Succor","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","roteDescription":"Just like tossing a new clip of ammunition to a buddy who's run out, Adamantine Arrow mages use this rote to make sure that everyone has sufficient resources to remain in a fight."}]}
