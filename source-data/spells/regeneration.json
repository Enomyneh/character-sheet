{"name":"Regeneration","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"193","primaryArcana":"Life","arcanaRequirement":"Life 5","requirements":[{"name":"Life","dots":"5"}],"practice":"Making","action":"Extended","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Vulgar","cost":"1 Mana","effect":"The mage can temporarily regenerate his own or another person's lost limb or organ. Lost limbs can be regrown and damaged or faulty organs can be restored to health. The number of successes needed depends on the limb or organ restored. Once this spell has been cast, the restored body part does not immediately appear. It grows at a rate of one success per minute until the total successes required for that organ are achieved, at which point the organ is fully functional. For example, a person can have a new arm (four successes) in four minutes. Obviously, a mage can only cast this spell upon a living target. The willworker cannot regenerate someone who has died (perhaps due to the loss of the body part concerned). This spell does not affect the target's Health rating. Note: This spell's Duration can be extended using the advanced prolonged Duration factors, but it cannot be made indefinite. When the spell expires, the body part withers back to its state before the casting (and disappears in the case of a restored limb) within one minute. It is rumored that archmasters might have the ability to cast this spell with indefinite Duration.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
