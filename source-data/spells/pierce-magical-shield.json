They shrugged off his son's bullets before they killed the boy. They chased Simplicius to an old quarry. That's when he prayed that God would forgive him for dabbling in the occult. He gave his magic up to God, and in seeming response, a stone dropped right into his open hand, jostled from above by a witch crawling down to ambush him. With perfect faith he looked up, threw the stone and knocked the formerly bulletproof enemy unconscious. Simplicius managed to frighten off the rest with a few handfuls of rocks, got away, and shared his revelation with other Banishers."}]}
