Free Council mages were quick to \"crack\" wireless Internet and cell communications in order to provide them with constant free and accessible service, making their cell phones, PDAs and laptops little more than talismans for the mystic \"aether-net.\" Note that this spell doesn't provide a network device with any capabilities it doesn't normally possess other than providing a free and open connection to the existing network. Still, the usefulness of searching the web, making cell calls, and sending and receiving e-mail in the depths of a ruined temple or in an isolated locale shouldn't be underestimated."}]}
