Used as a last resort and a final act of defiance, this spell allows the Banisher to submit to death rather than face capture and torment by order mages. The Banisher also reaffirms her commitment to erasing magic from the world by removing herself, and the tainted power within her, from it.To cast this spell successfully is to die. A Banisher who has contemplated the magic necessary for this spell is ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for his cause. The spell targets and shuts down vital physiological functions (such as the heart and the lungs) of the caster's body.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Martyr","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","roteDescription":"This \"rote\" is obviously not gained through practice; it might be attained through study of a particular grimoire, or even learned instinctively after a series of terrible dreams. When used to its greatest effect, this rote is combined with a spell, Artifact, or imbued item that removes the Banisher's soul beyond the reach of magic. Banishers know all too well that dead men sometimes can be forced to tell tales."}]}
