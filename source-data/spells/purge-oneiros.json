The mage uses this spell to cast out unwanted astral travelers. Astral travelers in the mage's Oneiros whose successes equal or exceed the caster's remain in Astral Space. All others wake up; they may attempt to return to their Oneiroi the standard way, if they wish. Note that the spell's target is the Oneiros, not the mages within it. At Mind 5, the mage may cast this on another's Oneiros; if the Oneiros's owner is unwilling, subtract his Composure from the roll.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Dropping Off Hitchhikers","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Unwanted astral travelers in one's dream space are like saboteurs of the mind.
