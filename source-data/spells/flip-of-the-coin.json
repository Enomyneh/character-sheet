This sense works only under circumstances where consequences are immediate (someone wins the coin toss or the bomb blows up). Even one success accrued in the casting of the spell enables a mage to automatically succeed (or fail if he wishes) at an uncontested action with only two possible outcomes and immediate consequences for success or failure. (In this case \"uncontested\" could mean a coin toss or bucking up for evens or odds, despite the fact that there are two participants, since no one can normally exert effort to win.) Note that this effect cannot be used in relation to combat, since a fight is contested (opponents exert effort to win) and the variables are more than simple success or failure (one can win but at the cost of major wounds, or the fight can result in a draw or surrender).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Instant Gratification","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"Mages of the Free Council understand that sometimes what others perceive as luck or a good sense of intuition is nothing more than the product of knowing how it's all going to turn out."}]}
