He may either add it to his Mana store or disperse it into the Tapestry, as he wishes. Most experienced willworkers are quick to point out the folly almost always inherent to pillaging a locus. Even if there are no werewolves present (a rare enough occurrence), spirits regard loci in the same way that mages look at Hallows, and resent those who cheat them of their rightful sustenance. While not all spirits have the means to exact immediate retribution, most have long memories and at least a few allies willing and able to make life hell for pirating mages. Each success siphons one Essence from the targeted spirit, ghost, or locus.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Ehrlik's Due","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","RoteDicePool_Resisted":"Resistance","roteDescription":"Most Adamantine Arrow mages who make use of this rote see it as a simple case of requisitioning needed resources. Sometimes this spell is used offensively, stripping power from enemy spirits before it can be used against a mage and her allies. Guardians of the Veil apply the same rote to drain Essence from spirits, robbing them of their ability to cause mischief or harm, and potentially endanger the anonymity of the occult world and its denizens."}]}
