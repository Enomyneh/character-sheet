Each success on a casting of this spell reduces the amount of time a mage needs to get a full night of rest by half. A mage who has remained awake for 24 hours or less needs eight hours; one success reduces the required sleep period to four hours, two successes reduces it to two hours and so on. If the mage is suffering fatigue to the degree that it increases the time she must spend sleeping, the spell divides however long she needs to sleep. Note that this spell does not ensure that the character will sleep well, only that her mind and body needs less time than usual to awake refreshed. This spell cannot be used consecutively within the same week more times than the mage's rating in the Mind Arcanum.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Freeing The Time Of The Night","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"The greatest of the order's strategists are constantly in demand. There are more decisions to be made than even twice their number could handle in the time they have. For them, there is no greater resource than time -- and purchasing it with mastery of the appropriate Arcanum has too high a cost. Instead, the top brass utilize this rote to significantly reduce the amount of time they actually need to rest. Agents in the field also use it, sometimes out of a need for a quick rest, sometimes out of simple paranoia -- the less time a Guardian spends in one place and asleep, the safer she is."}]}
