{"name":"Astral Tass Conversion","sourceBook":"Astral Realms","sourcePage":"28","arcanaRequirement":"Prime 3","primaryArcana":"Prime","requirements":[{"name":"Prime","dots":"3"}],"practice":"Weaving","action":"Instant","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Covert","cost":"None","effect":"When traveling into Astral Space, every mage carries with her the Mana she can normally call upon in the real world. What she lacks is a store of tass from which she can replenish that supply -- and this spell makes that possible. The mage casts this spell before she begins meditating to enter Astral Space. Tass containing one point of Mana per success becomes available to her during her astral journey. Equivalent or greater tass must be on the mage's person in the real world; Prime 4 allows the character to cast this spell at sensory range, and Prime 5 allows this spell to be cast sympathetically. Consuming the tass in astral consumes a similar amount of tass in the material world. Without additional Duration factors, the tass is available only for the character's first scene in Astral Space.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder","roteName":"Shining Reserves","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Never go anywhere without some extra resources to help you pull through the fight.
