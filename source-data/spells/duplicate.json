The mage casts the spell on himself, storing it for later use (this storage counts against the mage's Spell Tolerance). Casting the spell requires the expenditure of one Mana and a single success on the casting roll. This spell may have its Duration increased to one day by spending an additional Mana during the casting. Only one instance of Duplicate may exist on a mage at any time. Activating the stored spell is a reflexive action that costs one Mana. Once the spell is active, the next instant action performed by the mage will be doubled as though the mage had performed the action twice. Any expenditure required by the repeated action must be paid for twice, and any penalties accrued by that action will be inflicted twice.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Multiplicity","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The origins of this rote are dubious at best. Legend states this rote was developed by a warrior-mage Exarch shortly before his ascension to the Realms Supernal via the Celestial Ladder. Regardless of the rote's origin, the obvious advantages of this spell led to its further development by the Adamantine Arrow. The ability to increase damage done versus time spent is of interest to any warrior."}]}
