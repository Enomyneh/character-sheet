The replacement anchor is often an Enchanted Item. Penalties may apply, depending on the nature of the original and replacement anchors. An additional -2 dice penalty applies when the nature of the original anchor differs from the replacement, for example, when the mage attempts to take a ghost anchored to a place and instead attach the ghost to an object. If the ghost is bound to multiple anchors, a willworker desiring its full attention may wish to perform the spell multiple times, once per anchor. Users of this spell often cast it in conjunction with the Death 2 spell Lighten Anchor, granting the ghost greater flexibility in fulfilling the item owner's requests.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
