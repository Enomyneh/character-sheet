This effect can protect the mage's Destiny Merit against being detected or altered by another willworker, for example, or shield an oath against having its conditions altered by outside magic. The spell's Potency contends against all other mages' attempts to perceive or alter the target's destiny. If this spell is cast upon an unwilling mage, a reflexive, contested Composure + Gnosis roll is made to resist.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Hidden Treasure","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"Guardians must sometimes create destinies in order to protect the Mysteries, and those destinies must be protected. Likewise, they are on occasion forced to conceal the fortune of people, places, or things so that Sleepers will remain blissfully ignorant. Silver Ladder willworkers have also used this magic (Composure + Subterfuge + Fate) to occlude their own (often powerful) destinies, so as to go unnoticed when stealth and secrecy are required."}]}
