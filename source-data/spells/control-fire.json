Likewise, he can deprive an existing fire of fuel, dampening or even extinguishing it. When fueling a fire, successes are allocated between size and heat, with each success either doubling the fire's size or adding one point to its heat damage. When dampening a fire, each success subtracts one from the damage it delivers. Once it has no more damage rating, it is extinguished. For example, a torch delivers two points of damage (one from size, the other from heat). One success diminishes that to one point of damage, while two successes extinguish it completely. Extinguishing a fire is lasting (the fire doesn't re-ignite when the spell expires).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Dry Water","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult or Science","roteDescription":"It is not unknown for Free Council mages to accidentally start fires in their laboratories.
