Identifying a specific type of species requires a reflexive Intelligence + Animal Ken roll. If the target is a plant, Science, Survival, or Medicine is rolled instead. The mage can even discern the breed (or breeds) of an animal, perhaps to detect whether its owner's claim of full-breed status is true. A non-human, supernatural creature can be identified, provided the mage has seen its like before. If not, its species remains unknown (this fact alone is sure to raise a mage's curiosity).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Classify Specimen","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Survival (plants) or Animal Ken (animals) or Medicine (humans)","roteDescription":"In all things, there is hierarchy, and the teeming life is no exception.
