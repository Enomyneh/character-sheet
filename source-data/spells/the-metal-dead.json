This acts as the spell Quicken Corpse, but it converts the zombie's Health into Structure (base points equal to its Size). It gains no Structure from its Resistance. The caster may also spend successes on Durability on a 1 for 1 basis, which increases its Structure normally (1 per point) and acts as armor. The zombie can inflict lethal damage in close combat but can't perform tasks that require fine motor control. It can carry or drag large objects, for example, but can't turn a doorknob. It has the same intellectual capacity as a normal zombie. Like any object, anyone trying to damage it barehanded suffers a point of bashing damage per strike. The \"zombies\" are actually metal skeletons, lashed together with alchemically altered, reconfigured sinews, festooned with sharp flanges and bits of sticky flesh that didn't fall off when the things cut themselves out of their bodies.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Blade Broken","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"Andy designed this rote as a work of art.
