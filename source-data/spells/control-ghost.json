A single, simple command (\"Attack!\" \"Flee!\" \"Stand there!\") can be issued per success. Complex commands require multiple successes. For example, \"Go to the Contessa's mansion and steal the Borgia Diamond!\" might require three successes. If the ghost has not completed the action by the time the Duration expires, it does not have to finish the job. It must, however, work to complete the command as soon as possible.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Word Of Woe","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Resistance","roteDescription":"The unquiet dead can be potent allies, and Silver Ladder mages waste no resource. Some use the shades of the departed as simple shock troops, while the more cunning compel them to reveal desired knowledge or to use the subtle abilities of the dead in pursuits other than battle. Mysterium willworkers often find uses for a closely related rote (Manipulation + Intimidation + Death) in their endless endeavor to gather up the hoary secrets of the world."}]}
