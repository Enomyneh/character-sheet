He can perceive energy and magical resonance, detecting the presence of all of the universe's various forms of energy: Heat, gravity, electromagnetism, and the like, including the presence or absence of different sorts of radiation, such as x-rays or cosmic radiation, either visually or through tactile perception. An undiscerning mage might be fairly blinded by the overwhelming variety and sheer quantity of energy that moves around her at all times, unable to process the ever-shifting tapestry of power that is all but invisible to the untrained eye. The mage is also especially aware of resonance's energetic aspects and flow, its vibratory frequency and movement. Check the information on Resonance for rules on scrutinizing magic with this spell. When scrutinizing energetic phenomena (like the electromagnetic spectrum), the more invisible that energy is to the naked eye, the more dice penalties the mage suffers.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
