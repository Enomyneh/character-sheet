That spell does not take effect; instead, the one-time ability to activate the spell's effect passes to the ghost. The ghost can use the effect at any time thereafter, as an instant action. The roll for the subject spell is made when the ghost chooses to unleash it, using the mage's relevant dice pool. The ghost gains the benefit from any positive effects of the roll that would apply to the mage. Where story logic permits, however, all ill effects, including Paradoxes and dramatic failures, are suffered by the willworker, even if she is a great distance from the ghost when the spell is used. The spell itself provides no guarantee that the ghost will use its spell in the manner specified. Any such assurances depend on negotiation or coercion between willworker and ghost.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Bolt From The Grave","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The restless ghosts of fallen Adamantine Arrow warriors relish the opportunity to strike out against the enemies of their glorious order, and are anxious to be armed with spells of the most devastating caliber."}]}
