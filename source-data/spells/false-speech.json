The lesser variant of this spell is cast on an area and is stationary, while the greater variant can be cast on an individual or object, and moves with its target. In both versions of the spell, the mage needs to be able to multitask (through the casting of different spells of the Mind Arcanum) in order to make different people seem to say different things if more than one is talking at the same time. Otherwise, all the words come out the same. Every subject who rolls fewer successes than the caster hears whatever the mage wants her to hear whenever anyone in the radius of effect speaks. Subjects who succeed in contesting the magic instead hear garbled words while within the effected area (since Forces magic still mangles the sounds).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Miscommunication","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Without understanding, there is no such thing as cooperation.
