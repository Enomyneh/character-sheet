Successes determine the Dead Zone's radius or volume (the mage chooses which during casting). While a mage can spend his own Mana within a dead zone, he cannot use the Channel Mana spell to draw them from another source. Small animals, children, and the elderly may sicken and even die in places devoid of a natural flow of Mana energies.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil","roteName":"Banishing","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"By disrupting the local flow of Mana, a Guardian can sometimes stop conspicuous paranormal activity in an area."}]}
