With only the slightest application of magic, a mage can point out the weak spot in any structure, the central point on which the structure's integrity depends. Knowing the weak point of an edifice means that a true craftsman can act on it, protecting it from tampering and bolstering the integrity of the building as a whole. Conversely, it makes demolition easy. The Tamer of Stone assesses a building or similar structure, and spots its weaknesses. Success means that the mage has isolated a single weak point, which can be exploited. If the mage concentrates an attack on this weak spot (for example, if he sets explosives right next to it), the mage can bring the structure crashing right down. The Size of the structure affects the caster's dice pool","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"The Can At The Base Of The Stack","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"That single can at the foot of the stack can bring the whole pyramid crashing down.
