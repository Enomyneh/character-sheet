He may either add this Mana to his own or disperse it into the Tapestry, as he wishes. Most such Patterns have but little Mana invested in them and siphoning it all away (or simply dispersing it) damages the item. Each success gives the mage one Mana and inflicts one point of Structure damage to the object, making it brittle. (This damage circumvents the object's Durability.) Only one point of Mana may be gleaned per three points of Size (rounding down); mundane objects smaller than Size 3 simply do not have enough material substance and presence to hold a full point of Mana. The caster can replenish his own Mana reserves with this spell only once every 24 hours. The frayed Mana from successive castings cannot be integrated into the mage's Pattern during that time, although he could use the Channel Mana spell to divert it elsewhere. Enchanted items cannot be siphoned with this spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Arrow Rote","roteName":"Hidden Stores","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"For a Mysterium mage skilled in the Prime Arcanum, stores of Mana are hidden in plain sight throughout the Tapestry. Providing a much-needed boost on short notice, this rote draws on the willworker's immediate environment to replenish his power. Members of the Adamantine Arrow use similar magics (Strength + Occult + Prime) to simultaneously strip their opponents of needed items or protections while recouping their own stores of Mana."}]}
