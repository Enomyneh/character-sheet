A mage using this spell can go without sleep for an extended period, with no impairment of faculties, at least until fatigue becomes too great. Mages find it most useful to forgo rest when they must focus their attention on a task for a long period of time. Each spellcasting success allows the mage to go an additional six-hour period without sleep with no need for a Stamina + Resolve roll. The mage suffers none of the penalties for missed sleep during this time. The maximum this spell can put off the need for sleep is a number of days equal to the lower of the mage's Stamina or Resolve, after which the spell no longer works. Once the spell ends, the mage suffers all the effects of any missed sleep and must make it up (an additional hour's sleep per six-hour period forgone using this spell).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"All-Nighter","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"Free Councilors often find it necessary to stay up all night (or for a few days, for that matter) to complete a particular project, and they don't necessarily want the jitters of caffeine or other stimulants interfering with their faculties. Some say this rote dates back to the Nameless War, when many Libertines were afraid to sleep at all, preferring to remain on their guard."}]}
