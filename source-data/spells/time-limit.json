This spell is cast during item creation. The Storyteller secretly makes the spell roll for the character, noting the interval on the following chart. At the end of the interval, all of the item's magical properties -- not only the spell to which Time Limit originally applied -- cease to function for the item's current owner. After a transfer of ownership, the item again functions for its inherent interval, then shuts down again. Previous owners may never again access the item's powers. If multiple instances of Time Limit are cast on the same item, the lowest interval applies.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
