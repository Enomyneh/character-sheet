She drinks in the knowledge that this Final Name contains, the summation of all that its owner was. The mage must have access to the physical, stored form of a Final Name as created by the Fate 2 Scribe Final Name spell. By studying the Final Name, the mage gains insight into the owner of that Name. She automatically learns the owner's Virtue and Vice, and can gain a limited understanding of the subject's sympathetic ties of Fate. The more successes the character achieves, the more remote are the ties discovered. The caster identifies one connection per success rolled. A character can search for particular sorts of connections (relatives, lovers, objects and so on) or just fish at random. This spell's Duration is transitory if cast on the recorded Momentary Name of a still-living being, but prolonged if cast on a deceased person. If the mage has Fate 2, the Duration is prolonged when cast on the living and uses the Advanced Prolongation chart when used to study the Final Name of the dead.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
