While many mages can manipulate the quality of their personal resonance or cloak it entirely, none do so with the finesse of a willworker skilled in Prime. He can alter the nature of his aura, appearing to be a Sleeper (or even an inhuman creature), or he can hide it or even disperse it completely for a time. Though an aura returns to its original state once the spell expires, it can be warded away for quite some time. Only by overcoming the Potency of this spell (with a spell such as Supernal Vision) can a mage detect the true aura. See the Aura chart under the Aura Perception spell for a list of some aura natures. If this spell is cast conjunctionally with Mind 2, the mage can alter the appearance of his aura's mental and emotional state, as per the Mind 2 Alter Aura spell. This spell cannot be detected except by a \"Supernal Vision\" Mage Sight spell with a higher Potency. Even once this spell is detected, the true nature of the mage cannot be perceived until the Transform Aura spell expires or is dispelled.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Taoist Tradition Rote","roteName":"Thunder Meditation","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","roteDescription":"The mage uses a meditative oblation to collect Mana during a thunderstorm. The rote enables her to imbue the Mana with elemental resonances and store it in her viscera, so that motes (points) with different resonances do not mix. This gives the Taoist reservoirs of Mana with whatever resonance she needs for a particular working. Each success changes the resonance of one mote and binds it to a particular organ."}]}
