(Note that sentient beings of whatever kind are not considered base life.) By transmuting the living energy of a plant, such as a growing flower or unripe acorn, a mage can transform such life into another form of life entirely, such as an insect swarm. Alternately, the mage can change one kind of insect (or other simple invertebrate life) into another (such as a cockroach into a wasp or an earthworm into a millipede). At this level, the mage must touch the target. With Life 3, he can cast this spell at sensory range. The mage can affect a target of Size 20 or less. If the target is larger, dice penalties are levied on the spellcasting roll. He can transform a subject into a creature with a Size typical for that type of creature. A large oak tree (Size 10) can be transformed into a small bonsai tree (Size 1), but not into a Size 10 bonsai tree. Transforming a smaller life form (the bonsai) into a larger life form (the oak) levies dice penalties. If the caster wants to change a life form (such as a tree) into an insect swarm, the size of an insect swarm depends on the Size of the life form that was transformed. To direct the swarm, the mage can cast the Control Base Life spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
