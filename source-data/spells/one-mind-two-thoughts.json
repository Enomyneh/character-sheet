He creates parallel processes within his conscious mind. While he cannot do anything that requires intense or exacting physical labor (like fixing a computer and planning out a rousing speech at the same time), one of his two actions can require extremely minimal physical exertion (like planning a speech and typing an editorial for the local paper). The willworker can hold two thoughts in mind simultaneously, allowing him to perform two separate extended-action knowledge tasks (as opposed to instant actions or extended tasks involving physical labor) at the same time. He could, for example, research an occult fact while composing a poem, but could not do either while also fixing a car.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Thinking For Many","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"Leaders think not only for themselves, but also for those whom they would keep as vassals. Willworkers of the Silver Ladder use this rote to conduct the many tasks of rule in the limited time usually available to them. Mages of the Mysterium also occasionally use the same rote, especially when considering weighty matters of exceedingly obscure lore."}]}
