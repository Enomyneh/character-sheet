Even spirits, who rely on certain qualities of resonance for feeding, can be fooled by this spell. Each success also masks one level of a Hallow's power. For example, two successes make a 3-dot Hallow look like a 1-dot Hallow. Or she could make it appear to be a greater place than it is, making a 3-dot Hallow appear to be a 5-dot Hallow with two successes. This spell cannot be detected except by a Mage Sight spell with a higher Potency. Even once this spell is detected, the true resonance of the area cannot be perceived until the Disguise Resonance spell expires or is dispelled.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Mask Of The Spirits","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"An ounce of misdirection can be far more effective at times than a dozen trained guardsmen.
