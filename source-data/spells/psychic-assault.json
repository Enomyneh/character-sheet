Most  mages of that order are content to allow detractors such illusions, keeping their silence about rotes such as this one. Often dismissed as a seizure or other neurological ailment, this magic constitutes a potent weapon in the Arrow arsenal. In fact, it is so effective and discrete that it is used, in one form or another, by most mages sufficiently skilled in the Mind Arcanum."}]}
