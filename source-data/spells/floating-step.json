Once cast, the spell provides the 8 again advantage to Dexterity + Athletics rolls to maintain balance, making it easy for a well-trained mage to run across tightropes or jump from one narrow post to another. The mage also adds her Forces dots in feet for every success scored whenever she succeeds at a Strength + Athletics roll. For example, if she scores 4 successes to make a standing broad jump and has Forces 3, she jumps 20 feet (2 per success as usual, + 3 per success using the spell).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Karumijutsu","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"The \"body lightening art\" gives practitioners the ability to leap incredible distances and balance on the most precarious surfaces."}]}
