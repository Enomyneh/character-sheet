She could decide to search for ferrous metals, clean water or a particular kind of plastic, even a unique object known to her (meaning that the mage almost never needs to worry about where she left her car keys, unless she lives in a singularly enormous house). Among other things, this spell can reveal if a person is carrying a handgun (by looking for gunpowder) or is wearing a wire (by examining for copper wiring on the torso). One success affects a one-yard radius. Additional successes extend the radius. The Storyteller levies penalties based on how much or how little of the substance is present. A guy carrying an arsenal of guns under his trench coat has a lot of gunpowder on his person: +2 or +3 bonus. Someone who is hiding a transmitter in his gold fillings has only a tiny amount of the copper wiring sought: -2 or -3.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
