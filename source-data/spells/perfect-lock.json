While in ancient times, this was done by weaving Space, giving them Pocket Realms, or the use of secure sanctums, in modern times, sometimes all a mage may need is a little privacy. By fusing the molecules of a door or window together, it becomes impossible to open the door, window, gate, etc. Even the mage himself cannot pass through the doorway without first canceling the spell. No key or application of the Larceny Skill can open the Perfectly Locked door. The spell will not prevent the door (or window, etc.) from being smashed or broken through, though some mages combine this with the Matter 3 spell Alter Integrity to ensure just that.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Perfectly Locked Cell","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"For all the Guardians' reputation as remorseless killers, the Guardians of the Veil do, on occasion, take prisoners. Mages are notoriously difficult to contain. However, this rote lets them briefly imprison any mage who lacks the Space Arcana. There are applications of this spell that combine with warding spells to create a temporary prison cell from which few mages (though certainly not all) can escape."}]}
