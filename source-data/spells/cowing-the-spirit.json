With rudimentary training in the mystic arts of the Shadow, a willworker can encourage such an entity to stir for just a moment, aiding in the task for which the instrument that houses the spirit was crafted. With slightly greater skill, one might frighten such a spirit away from its appointed duty, turning an otherwise trustworthy piece of equipment astray. Each success of Potency assigned to this spell reduces an item's equipment bonus by one, to a minimum of zero. All other qualities of the item, however, remain unaffected.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Turning Aside The Shadow","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","roteDescription":"When confronted by this rote, even the stoutest of blades and most accurate of guns fail. Willworkers of the Adamantine Arrow also use this magic to foil items of a less martial nature, aware that Existence Is War, and that all conflicts - regardless of their nature - are battlefields of a sort: Lock picks, first aid kits, computers, or any other sort of mundane equipment can be rendered virtually useless."}]}
