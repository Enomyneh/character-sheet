{"name":"Influence Fire","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"166","primaryArcana":"Forces","arcanaRequirement":"Forces 2","requirements":[{"name":"Forces","dots":"2"}],"practice":"Ruling","action":"Instant and aimed; subtract target's Defense","duration":"Transitory (one turn)","aspect":"Vulgar","cost":"None","effect":"The mage can influence the direction or flow of an existing flame. He can, for example, cause a campfire to leap from its place and onto a person, or direct the flame from a Zippo lighter in an arc to the pool of liquor on the countertop. He could not fan the flames to make a larger or hotter fire at this level. The mage does not directly attack a person or object with this spell; he instead manipulates an existing fire, moving it or directing it toward the target of his choice. The damage inflicted depends entirely on the size and heat of the fire. This spell usually causes the fire to exhaust its fuel in the following turn, although if targets are wearing highly flammable clothing, they might catch fire and continue to burn each turn until the fire is put out. A single success allows the fire to affect one target. (The mage can send the fire at any target within three yards of its origin per dot of Forces; a mage with Forces 2 can affect a target six yards away.) Excess successes affect additional adjacent targets next to one another (this is an exception to the normal rule that disallows aimed spells to affect multiple targets). Targets must each be within three yards in either direction of each other. The size of the source itself, however, limits the total number of targets that can be affected.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
