The spell is a means of prolonging life and also of obtaining a newer, younger, fitter body. Some mages also see it as an opportunity to experiment: Obtaining a body of a different sex, race, or the like in order to see how \"the other half\" lives (and dies, for that matter). The mage can cast this spell on a given target only once. If the spell fails, that target is forever immune to any further casting by that mage (although not by others). The mage obtains the subject's Strength, Dexterity, and Stamina, and any physical Merits or Flaws, retaining all other traits. The subject's spirit is destroyed although, at the Storyteller's discretion, the spirit may survive as a ghost (and likely a vengeful one at that).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Life-Transfer","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Resolve","roteDescription":"The body is just a vehicle for the mind and spirit, and techn&eacute; allow the unseating of an existing \"occupant\" so a new life-force can inhabit a body.
