The Tamers of the Cave can, on the other hand, do the opposite, granting longer life to others at the cost of their own. The threads of life are of a certain length, but a true altruist can, if he so wishes, transplant the end of his thread of life on to the end of someone else's. For every success the Tamer of the Cave gains, he can give one year of his own lifespan to the target of the spell. This spell cannot be cast on supernatural beings, including the Awakened. Its effects are for the most part in the hands of the Storyteller. It doesn't prevent the effects of aging on the target, and the spell doesn't prevent death through violence, although it does slow the effects of disease. This spell can only be cast once per month per dot of Gnosis the mage has.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Gift Of Years","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","roteDescription":"The Libertine who uses this rote begins by coughing up the years of his life in the form of a small, black, round substance resembling a pearl. Then he gives it to the subject of the spell to eat, and eating passes on the years. Libertines who teach this rote do not use it often, understandably, and when they do, they choose subjects whom they consider to be worthy."}]}
