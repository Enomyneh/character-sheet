This spell functions as Imbue Item, save that this spell works on a living creature. The mage cannot affect human beings with this spell, though it's possible that an archmage might have this ability. Unlike Imbue Item, this spell is always vulgar, but all other particulars of that spell apply here. In addition, any use of this spell causes a check to avoid degeneration at Wisdom 5 or greater.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Genesis 1:26","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Animal Ken","roteDescription":"\"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\" The Banisher who created this rote quoted this passage whenever imbuing an animal with a spell. Though he is long dead, he inscribed the rote on numerous grimoires, marked with sigils intended to prevent anyone but Banishers from reading them."}]}
