He can sweep a fully automatic weapon through a crowd without fear of hitting Sleepers, blindly loose arrows or throw knives, or use the spell to guarantee that he isn't hitting a supernatural target's Sleeper double, or a Sleeper that he mistakenly thinks is a supernatural being. Prime and Space lock on to the auras of everyone in range; Forces turns bullets and other projectiles away from targets the spell \"tags\" as Sleepers. The spell doesn't directly reveal who is and isn't a Sleeper, but an observant mage who sees projectiles tumble away from certain targets will be able to figure it out. The mage must accept a penalty based on the maximum area of effect in which the spell will function. There are also a number of ways to fool the spell. A supernatural target who suppresses his aura or masks it as a Sleeper's will not be struck by projectiles fired under the influence of the spell. Sleepers with altered auras may not be able to take advantage of the spell's protection.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Take The Shot","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Firearms","roteDescription":"Rumor has it that this spell was originally developed by a former police sniper. The inventor's name has been lost, but gun-toting Banishers have passed it around amongst themselves ever since. Thanks to this spell, a Banisher almost never needs to worry about shooting the wrong person -- by Banisher standards, at least."}]}
