{"name":"Flight","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"177","primaryArcana":"Forces","arcanaRequirement":"Forces 5","requirements":[{"name":"Forces","dots":"5"}],"practice":"Making","action":"Instant","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Vulgar","cost":"1 Mana","effect":"The mage acquires the power of flight, using telekinetic force to repel herself from the surface of the Earth and upward into the air. This is a more advanced version of Forces 4 Levitation. The mage now has more maneuverability and no longer needs to maintain concentration to lift away from gravity's pull. Success allows the mage to fly and travel in any direction with a maximum Speed equal to her Gnosis +1 per success (she cannot double this as she could by running on the ground). Reflexive Dexterity + Athletics rolls are made to avoid obstacles, and she gains her normal Defense against attacks that can reach her. If she is stunned or suffers a knockout or is rendered unconscious (perhaps by wounds), she begins to descend as her flight becomes uncontrolled. She does not fall, but slowly floats downward at a rate of Speed equal to her Size, touching ground without injury. If the spell's Duration expires before she touches down, she falls like anyone dropped from her current height. This spell instantly invokes Disbelief in Sleeper witnesses, which immediately works to unravel the magic.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Witch's Broom","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Dexterity","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"This rote allows members of the Mysterium to avoid both the hassles and occasional perils of earthbound transportation. Granted, flight bears its own unique problems and risks, but no few mages are willing to accept them. Adamantine Arrow sorcerers use the same rote in conferring the powers of flight upon themselves."}]}
