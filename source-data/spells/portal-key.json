The mage can also use the Portal Key to declare who can (and cannot) pass through the portal. Unlike the normal rules for spell control, the mage can cast this on a pre-existing portal of his own or he can combine it with the creation of a portal.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Attuning The Gateway","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Silver Ladder mages use this rote both as a means to program their spatial gateways and to craft instantaneous portals when a situation suddenly turns unfavorable."}]}
