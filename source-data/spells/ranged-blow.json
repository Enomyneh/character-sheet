For the scene following casting, the mage can make ranged Brawl or Weaponry attacks against targets within sensory range. One Mana must be spent for the caster per attack. These attacks have all the benefits (the target does not get his Defense) and drawbacks (range penalties as per an aimed spell) of a ranged attack.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Long Hand Technique","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Dexterity","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"This technique allows the magus to channel his qi into the same patterns used to strike an opponent. The only difference is, the opponent need not be standing next to the martial artist to be struck by that qi. In the Imago, the mage sees himself send forth his Supernal mastery as an image of himself standing before the foe.
