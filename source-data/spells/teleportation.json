Through use of this spell, which is invaluable to spies, couriers, fighters, and just about anyone else who has reason to get to (or away from) somewhere in a hurry, mages get where they need to be, no matter how distant from where they are. As with creating a Portal, the wise mage first scrys his destination. Sometimes there is no time for such caution, however, and the willworker must simply hope that wherever he's going is better than where he is. The mage must have a sympathetic connection to his destination. The weaker the sympathetic connection, the more penalties his spellcasting roll suffers.A location that he is currently scrying is a Known sympathetic connection (-4). He can teleport himself, his familiar (if he has one), and anything he wears or carries (provided it's not too large; he needs one extra success per Size rating above 3). Cast conjunctionally with Spirit 4, this spell can teleport the user across the Gauntlet.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Wormhole","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Sometimes used as an escape route and sometimes as a means to reach otherwise inaccessible locales, this rote is occasionally employed simply as a mode of transportation.
