In theory, a mage using this spell could identify transmissions from alien lifeforms, hear the \"music of the spheres\" as the planets and stars emit their telltale signature noises or catch the sound of approaching spacecraft. Naturally, if no such data or noise is present, the spell produces only silence or white noise. A Wits + Science roll is made to enable the mage to pick out and identify the type of signal she is receiving. To break a code, an additional Wits + Occult or Computer may be necessary, while an Intelligence + Language roll can determine if the signal contains a message.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Invasion Alert","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"A Banisher may use this rote to determine if the signal is hostile and if it signals an imminent attack. By substituting Time for Forces in the dice pool, the Banisher may get a sense of the approximate time remaining before the attack arrives."}]}
