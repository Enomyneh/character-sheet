This spell is similar to Temporal Pocket except the spell only affects the mage's mental state: The mage is able to think for an extended period of time \"in between\" moments. Successes are assigned to the spell's Duration, affecting the subjective time the mage has in which to think. So, at a basic level, the mage can consider for up to an hour while no time at all appears to pass for everyone else. Additional successes increase this time as usual for a prolonged spell. The caster under this spell is \"inside\" his or her own mind and has no resources other than what the mage can think or imagine. Still, the mage may be able to undertake and complete extended mental actions, appearing to accomplish them in just a moment's time. This does not include extended spellcasting, as that is not a purely mental action.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Seven Thoughts In A Moment","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"When a mage needs a \"moment to consider,\" this techn&eacute; is just the thing, since it usually grants more than enough time to puzzle out a particular situation, giving Free Councilors a reputation for the ability to think of their feet."}]}
