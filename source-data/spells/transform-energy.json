All kinds of energy have their origins in certain physical principles that manifested long ago and diverged from a single course. Using that sympathy, a mage can change one kind of energy into another. Electricity, for example, can be transformed into sound. (As with the Sound Mastery spell, however, a separateSkill roll might be required to generate exacting sounds. The mage could easily get screams or gunfire, but it's harder to get a specific person screaming or the telltale sound of a certain model of gun.) Light could be changed into heat, meaning that a blindingly bright room could become pitch-black and searingly hot. The existing energy is transformed, but it is not increased or diminished unless cast in combination with a spell that allows that effect. Use the chart below as a general guideline for transforming one form of energy into another.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
