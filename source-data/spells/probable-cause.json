The player can choose which of his rolls are affected by this altered probability, and they can include any action or task, although he must decide before the dice are rolled. This effect lasts for one scene (unless additional Duration factors are added during casting), after which time any unused Probable Cause re-rolls are lost. Note that this spell does allow the player to re-roll a failure on a chance die. This spell cannot be \"stacked\" with Exceptional Luck or Superlative Luck; only the most potent spell takes effect.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Assured Acquisition","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"This is a rote for those times when a Guardian simply must not fail in protecting the hidden world from the eyes of the uninitiated.
