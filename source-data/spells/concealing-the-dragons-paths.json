This may be used as a way of protecting valuable sources of power from rivals or to preserve a path of power for the caster's use. The mage must first know where the particular ley line or node of ley lines is. The spell itself puts up a powerful masking barrier that only a caster with greater power or who possesses the ability to see through strong illusions can penetrate. The ley lines, or dragon lines as they are sometimes called, are said to lead back to Atlantis, if one knows the proper sequence of paths to take. The spell can, therefore, be used to protect what's left of proud Atlantis from prying eyes and nosy Sleepers. It can also be used to cover one's path once a mage has traversed the lines to their destination.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Vigilant Safeguard","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Survival","roteDescription":"The Mysterium uses this rote to make precious and rare locations or objects \"disappear\" from the sight of Sleepers or even other mages.
