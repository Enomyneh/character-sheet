Note that the participant(s) need not be aware that the mage has the means to place metaphysical momentum behind such vows. An individual considered to own or bear responsibility for the life of another (such as a child's parent) can swear oaths in that person's name. If the target is unaware that the words he's about to utter will bind him into a mystical oath, he gets to unconsciously contest the spell with a reflexive Resolve + Gnosis roll. Note that this spell is tallied against the total amount of spells the mage can maintain (and it counts toward the spell tolerance of those who are affected by the oath). The caster can, however, choose to relinquish the spell so that it no longer counts against the total of his maximum spells allowed.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Let Their Words Condemn Them","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Those who would offer solemn oaths to a mage of the Silver Ladder should be wary of this rote, lest their words be rendered truly binding. Willworkers of the Mysterium also make use of this powerful magic in the course of their work, whether to hold another to a promise of aid or to a vow to deliver a certain artifact by a given date."}]}
