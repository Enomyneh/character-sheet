A mage with this spell can generate that sensation, regardless of whether or not it is genuine. This sort of normally spontaneous connection can make a chosen person feel more at ease in the mage's presence and may help to lay the groundwork for a friendship, love affair, or even just a con. Each success adds one die to the dice pool of the first Social Attribute-based roll made for the mage in regard to an individual she meets for the first time. The result of that first impression tends to stick with the subject and color the rest of her interactions with the mage.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"A Face You Can Trust","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Socialize","roteDescription":"It helps when you can back up charm with some substance, but charm alone can do the trick if it's possessed in abundance. Council mages make use of this rote to set the tone for interactions with others. Members of the Silver Ladder are also known to use the same magic, seeing nothing wrong in stacking the deck in their own favor."}]}
