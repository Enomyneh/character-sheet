With this spell, a mage can render a victim unable to use these devices, banishing them from the modern world. Starting with the turn after casting, the targeted individual is surrounded by a magical field that disrupts electronic items. Any such item he attempts to use for the duration of the spell is subject to a penalty to its equipment dice equal to the successes on the spell, up to the caster's Fate dots. If the equipment dice are reduced to zero, the item does not function -- computers shut off, electronic brakes in cars fail to respond, and lights do not work.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"Anti-Electronic Field","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"The Seers of the lesser Pantechnicon Ministry believe modern technology to be an excellent cage and controlling mechanism for humanity. Central to their doctrine is the precept that humanity walks into that cage themselves. Sometimes, an object lesson is needed as to why technology is a good thing. Using the Anti-Electronic Field, the Seers demonstrate just what a life without modern conveniences is like."}]}
