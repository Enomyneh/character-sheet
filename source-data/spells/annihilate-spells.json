A capable Banisher can spread this effect across an area. Mages are fragile beings, but given enough time, any mage can take several gunshots or wounds before collapsing, and every second that a mage isn't dead is another opportunity for him to turn the tables on his Banisher assailant. This spell allows the Banisher to strip away a mage's pre-existing advantages: Armor spells, hung spells, even Mage Sight. The Banisher uses Time to turn the \"clock\" ahead on an existing spell, and Prime to unravel it, much as Supernal Dispellation. Unlike that spell, however, the mage doesn't need to beat the spell's Potency, as he is attacking the spell as it will exist in the future (that is, as it starts to fade and lose its Potency). The Banisher must touch the mage to use this spell, but at Prime 5, he can cast it at sensory range. The mage can also work in target factors at this level, affecting several targets at once.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Oblivion","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The infamous Banisher known only as \"Brown\" perfected this rote, and used it to great effect against the mages of the Pacific Northwest. His cult, consisting only of Sleepers and Sleepwalkers, would wait until he removed the shields and other protective spells from their targets, and then the cult members would open fire."}]}
