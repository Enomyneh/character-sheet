At times when they must pore over tomes of lore as quickly as possible, the use of the Time Arcanum allows them to research in minutes what others would take hours to do. Each success allows the caster to make one Research roll per 15 minutes for extended action research, instead of the usual 30 minutes per roll.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"The Right Book","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Academics","roteDescription":"An Eleventh Question mage devised this rote after being forced to go through a suspect's rare book collection, looking for a specific clue about a breed of octopus used for a sympathetic connection to an acamoth.
