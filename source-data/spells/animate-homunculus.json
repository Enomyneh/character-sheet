{"name":"Animate Homunculus","sourceBook":"Tome Of The Mysteries","sourcePage":"151","primaryArcana":"Life","arcanaRequirement":"Life 5","requirements":[{"name":"Life","dots":"5"}],"practice":"Making","action":"Instant","duration":"Lasting","aspect":"Vulgar","cost":"None","effect":"The alchemist imbues a proto-homunculus, already gifted with form and a latent personality, with the final spark necessary to bring it to artifi cial life. To do so, the mage must permanently sacrifice a dot of Willpower. The homunculus sputters to life on one or more successes, but, depending on the number of successes, may face such a traumatic transition from the realm of the inanimate that the homunculus gains one or more derangements and/or Flaws. The Storyteller chooses these either at random or based on the individual on whom the homunculus' persona was modeled. If the model suffers from derangements or Flaws, the homunculus inherits one or more of them. If not, the Storyteller envisions an insanely exaggerated version of the model and picks derangements and Flaws to suit. The weaver of the homunculus' persona may have allocated successes to be able to personally select one or more of the derangements/Flaws. The mix of defects suffered depends on the number of successes scored on the roll for this spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
