A subject's Virtue and/or Vice may be changed (each requires a target number equal to the subject's Composure), and other parts of the subject's fundamental psychic makeup can be altered or even deleted. Each success can affect a single aspect of the subject's fundamental psychic makeup, such as turning a friendship into a rivalry, making the target fall out of (or into) love, or making him follow a new career calling. Although this spell's effect is lasting against Sleepers, it can be dispelled (using Prime 1 Dispel Magic spell, Prime 4 Supernal Dispellation spell, or Death 5 Quell the Spark spell to undo reprogramming and to restore the target to his previous state.
