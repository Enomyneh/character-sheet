Other mages, though, have to expend resources and move quickly to avoid problems with the law arrives, and so some Banishers know how to quickly summon the authorities. The Banisher sends out a signal on a police frequency. Rather than sending out a specific vocal transmission (using the Transmission spell), the Banisher simply sends a pulse that computers read as \"officers need assistance.\" This spell doesn't work well in rural areas where all field communication uses two-way radios, but in cities where every patrol car has its own onboard computer, a Banisher can look forward to flashing lights in a few short minutes. Banishers who make use of this spell often take the time to learn how the police (or other emergency services) communicate in the area. This spell might be used as a last resort, summoning the police to scatter combatants if things go wrong, or it might be part of the Banisher's plan all along.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"10-13","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Streetwise","roteDescription":"This rote was created by an Obrimos Banisher who, pre-Awakening, was a police dispatcher.
