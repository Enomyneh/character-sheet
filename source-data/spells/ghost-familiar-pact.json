See the Ghost Familiar Merit for more details. The target must purchase the Ghost Familiar Merit to secure the bond, which cannot be dispelled. As normal, only one familiar (ghostly or otherwise) may be pacted to one person at any given time. The caster must be able to see and speak to the desired ghost (see the Death 1 spell Speak with the Dead, and he must be able to touch it with each extended roll. If the ghost is physically manifested during the casting, however, then the willworker need not be able to communicate with or touch entities in Twilight to cement the familiar bond. As with conventional familiars, a ghost familiar must be willing to accept the mage's pact.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Forlorn Pact","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Sometimes by way of threats, bribes, or other forms of coercion, and sometimes on account of sincere offers of aid and companionship through the long, lonely years of restless death, mages of the Mysterium occasionally enter into the familiar bond with the shades of the departed. At least a few willworkers of all orders, however, know of and employ this grim magic."}]}
