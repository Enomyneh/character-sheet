To be imprinted in a spray, a spell must harm or influence a person, creature or supernatural entity. (Certain entities, such as ghosts and spirits, may be difficult or impossible to target with a spray.) The effect of the imprinted spell is triggered when the liquid is sprayed on its target. These sprays are most often delivered with modifi ed canisters originally used to contain mace or pepper spray. To use a spray canister, one must be within melee range of the target, and make a successful attack using Dexterity + Brawl or Firearms + an equipment bonus of 3.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Whiff Of Obedience","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","roteDescription":"Silver Ladder potentates often equip their underlings with sprayers laced with mind-influencing spells, allowing them to exact compliance from bureaucrats, functionaries and gatekeepers."}]}
