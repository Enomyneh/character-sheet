Successes provide various benefits in each of the following four categories all at once. They are not allocated among categories, but are applied separately to each to collect a series of benefits. For example, one success allows the mage to slow down his breathing, gives him +1 Initiative, doubles the amount of time he can go before suffering deprivation or fatigue, slows his heart, and halves his healing time for bashing wounds.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
