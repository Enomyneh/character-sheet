The target number equals the dots of the Hallow. The Hallow immediately yields up its rating in Mana, which can be harvested through normal means (by performing an oblation or casting Channel Mana). The effect lasts for one hour, but if it is made to last longer, the Hallow does not yield up more Mana until the same hour as its creation on each day for as long as the spell lasts. The spell uses the following Duration factors, but cannot be made to last indefinitely. While Hallows can conceivably be created anywhere, certain places are more conducive than others. High places, such as at the top of a mountain, tall hill, tree, or skyscraper are the best. If a mage attempts to cast this spell anywhere else, he suffers dice penalties. Casting at sea level is -1 die, while casting slightly below sea level, such as in a hollow, is -2 dice. Casting in a deep hole or pit is -3 dice.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
