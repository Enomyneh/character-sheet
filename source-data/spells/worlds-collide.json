When two or more objects (including people) are superimposed upon one another and allowed to interact, they are usually destroyed in a very messy fashion, as molecular lattices collide and drive each other apart. For living creatures, the result is usually crippling at the very least. One subject per Target factor can be affected. If even a single target succeeds in the contested resistance roll, none of the targets are co-located. The spell inflicts one point of aggravated damage per success. Once the targets contact one another, they are immediately repulsed and suffer Knockdown. They do not remain fused.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Shattered Images","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Stamina + Gnosis","roteDescription":"By crudely superimposing the spatial axes of multiple foes atop one another, a Ladder willworker is capable of striking them down, no matter where they stand or how they move. Those affected by such magic are often horribly maimed if not killed outright. Most mages caution against the spell's indiscriminate use, lest Wisdom be forsaken."}]}
