For every five successes added to the target number, the user of the item can borrow one success per roll on any action to which the item contributes an equipment bonus. The Storyteller takes note of the situation, type of action and number of successes borrowed. In a subsequent scene, when the user undertakes a similar action, the same number of successes is subtracted as dice from that roll, even if this means reducing the dice pool to a chance die. This occurs whether or not the user employs the item in that attempt. The Storyteller times this settling of temporal accounts so that the failure carries negative consequences roughly equal to what the character would have suffered in the original incident.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Temporal Marker","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The use of items enchanted with this spell reminds one of a popular Adamantine Arrow adage: \"Kill your enemies today; let tomorrow fend for itself.\" This motto is sometimes engraved on the items themselves."}]}
