The mage must first grab hold of or touch the target with a Strength or Dexterity + Brawl - the target's Defense. If that's successful, he can cast this spell as an instant action in the following turn. (With Mind 5, he can cast this spell at sensory range as an instant action. He needs Mind 6 before he can add Space 2 for a sympathetic casting.) Each success subtracts one dot from one of the target's Mental or Social Attributes, down to a minimum of 1. The maximum amount by which an Attribute can be lowered is equal to the mage's dots in the Mind Arcanum (Lowering Resolve or Composure also lowers the target's Willpower and Initiative, and lowering Wits might affect his Defense.) Note that the same spell cast to lower a different Mental or Social Attribute does not combine with the first spell -- only the highest Potency spell takes effect. For example, if a mage lowers a target's Intelligence by two dots and then casts a spell lowering the victim's Wits by one dot, only the first spell takes effect since it has the higher Potency.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Belittle The Brain","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","roteDescription":"The mages of the Silver Ladder often know how to degrade the reasoning abilities or social grace of debating rivals, reducing them to confused and stammering fools."}]}
