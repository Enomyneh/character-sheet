Creating a tornado in the American Midwest in the summer might impose a -1 dice penalty (depending upon current prevailing weather), while doing so in northern Alaska probably imposes a -5 dice penalty, regardless of the season. Long-term weather effects (storms, monsoons) take about five minutes after casting to grow into force, and dissipate as soon as the spell's Duration expires. Short-term effects arise immediately and disappear immediately when the spell expires.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Clearing The Streets","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","roteDescription":"Given the choice between creating a short-term panic with sudden hurricane-force winds and allowing Sleepers to bear witness to something that could utterly destroy the secrecy of the occult world, most Guardians opt for the former. This rote can also be used for purely destructive purposes, of course, and this \"wrath of heaven\" potential draws certain members of the Silver Ladder to learn the same magic."}]}
