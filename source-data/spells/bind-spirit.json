In some cases, this means tying the creature to a given location (which may be a form of imprisonment or even torture). When undertaken with indefinite Duration (with Spirit 5), this spell can confine a being to a place forever (usually somewhere out of the way and well guarded against intrusion), unless it is freed by other magic. The target number is one success per Rank of the spirit.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Chains Of Mist","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Resistance","roteDescription":"Sometimes cast as a reward, but commonly as a punishment, this rote enables a Silver Ladder mage to bind a spiritual entity in place in the material world (although the spirit is in the state of Twilight unless it has the ability to manifest). Most spirits fear confinement and do as they are bidden to avoid such a fate. Ladder willworkers, however, caution their students to use such this cruel magic as a scalpel rather than as a hammer -- sparingly, and only as often as absolutely necessary. Spirits have long memories. Mysterium mages use a similar rote in their own bindings."}]}
