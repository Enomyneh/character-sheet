The target number equals the ghost or spirit's Willpower. The ghost or spirit gets a contested roll using Power + Resistance. If the possession or haunting is caused by an Awakened spell (using Spirit Possession, Bind Spirit, or the Death 4 Haunting spell), the mage must dispel it instead. Note that in the case of the Ridden, the mage can drive the spirit out of a Spirit-Urged host but not out of the Spirit-Claimed. (He can, however, use the Spirit 5 Shape Spirit spell to separate the merged spirits).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Exiled From The Flesh","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Power + Resistance","roteDescription":"Often making use of forceful chants, invocations of divine powers and the like, Guardians use this magic to drive out a spiritual entity possessing a terrestrial host."}]}
