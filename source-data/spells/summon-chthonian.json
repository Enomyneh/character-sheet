Concealed within its arcane formulae is a summoning spell intended to call to the material realm one of the dread and alien chthonians. In order to summon a chthonian, a willworker must accrue five successes per desired effective spirit Rank of the entity: Five successes for a Rank 1 chthonian, for instance, or 20 for a creature of Rank 4. Further, two points of Mana must be spent in the casting for each Rank of the chthonian. This spell is not contested as chthonians appear to lack the wherewithal to resist a summons to the material realm (though they are perfectly capable of contesting any other magics directed at them once they are present). As specified, above, a summoned chthonian exists in the immaterial state of Twilight and cannot materialize, by any means. Further, no matter what steps are taken, the entity always returns to the Underworld at the next new moon, if not released (whether by the cast or under its own power) before such a time.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
