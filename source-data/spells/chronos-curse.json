As she sees it, everything around her occurs at an accelerated rate and she struggles to keep up. The target suffers a -1 penalty to Defense per success on the casting roll. Additionally, the subject's Speed is halved per success (rounding up), to a minimum of 1. When the victim of this spell attacks others with a ranged attack, her targets gain their Defense (even if the attack is not at point-blank range). The attacker moves slowly enough that others can anticipate her attack.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Crushed Beneath The Sands","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","RoteDicePool_Resisted":"Composure","roteDescription":"When afflicted by this magic, enemies of the sanctum or cabal usually prove easy prey. Mages of the Mysterium sometimes use a variant of this rote (Wits + Occult + Time) while making an escape with lore or relics \"appropriated\" from jealous owners."}]}
