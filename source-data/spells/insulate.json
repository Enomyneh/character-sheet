Seers that meditate on it as a metaphor for magic find the ability to protect themselves from the damaging effects of contact with electricity useful. The mage casting this spell becomes resistant to electrical shock. With Forces 3, it can be cast on others. The spell reduces the automatic damage inflicted by electricity by two points per dot of Forces of the caster. In addition, she automatically succeeds on the Strength roll to pull away.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"Protection Of The Second Name","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Survival","roteDescription":"Certain of the names of the General offer some protection against the fury of lightning, at least to a Seer that knows them."}]}
