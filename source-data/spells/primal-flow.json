Perhaps a single person can be shown too much and then marginalized as a potentially dangerous crackpot when he tries to convince others of what he has seen. At other times, allowing multiple Sleepers to perceive the same phenomenon can, with a measure of diligent effort, ultimately serve to convince them that nothing supernatural took place, that everything is normal."}]}
