Before casting, the mage must decide whether to adjust the strength of the line's flow or alter its direction. He could, however, cast this spell twice, once to lower the strength and again to alter its flow or vice-versa.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
