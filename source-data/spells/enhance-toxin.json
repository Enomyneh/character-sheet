This spell amplifies the deleterious qualities of a toxic substance, rendering it even more lethal to its victim than it normally would be. Each success assigned to this spell's Potency increases a poison's Toxicity by 1. Note that biological poisons and venoms may be enhanced by way of this spell, though not while still within the creature that produces them, unless the mage adds Life 3 to the casting.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"The Fatal Drop","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Animal Ken (for a poison or venom still inside an animal) or Science","roteDescription":"From their earliest days, certain among the servants of the Lie have resorted to the envenomed dagger and the poisoned chalice as tools of their masters' control.
