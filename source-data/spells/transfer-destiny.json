The mage casting the spell may be the recipient, the donor or a bystander. If either party is unwilling and aware of the spell, it may be contested by Resolve + Gnosis. Each success on the spell transfers one dot of the Destiny Merit from the donor to the recipient. At the end of the scene, the Merit transfers back to the donor, but if the recipient has used any destiny dice within that chapter, the donor may not use them until they refresh as per the Destiny Merit rules. The Destiny's bane also transfers for the duration of the spell -- the donor also keeps the bane unless all her Destiny Merit dots have been lost to the spell. The caster must touch both targets for the spell to take effect. With Fate 5 the spell can be cast at range.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"Theft Of Tomorrow","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The Seers of the Throne believe that history is made by powerful actors, individuals destined for great things, but they also believe that this mandate to influence the world can be stolen by the dedicated. As the Exarchs took the mantle of the Gods, this spell allows a clever Seer to take the mantle of mortal heroes."}]}
