This includes hairs, body fluids, fingerprints, as well as inorganic evidence such as footprints and fibers. The mage leaves an unusably blurry or distorted image on security camera videotapes or other recorded media. If the willworker's activity is the destruction of existence -- for example, the cleanup of blood and tissues from a murder scene -- the spell ensures that all incriminating materials are completely removed. If Sleepers are present, the spontaneous disappearance of bloodstains and other obvious evidence can strain credulity and provoke Disbelief. The willworker can prevent this by making a show of cleaning up the evidence by mundane means as a Life-only spell, in which case only organic evidence is eliminated, or as a Matter-only spell, wherein only inorganic evidence vanishes.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Mop Up","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"Corpses, notorious for exuding an assortment of messy and aggressively sticky excretions, conspire to incriminate those responsible for the bodies' deaths. Assassins of the Adamantine Arrow counter their victims' tendency to leave behind inconvenient residues with this widely useful rote. Despite its name, the rote's general applicability to infiltration and burglary missiolns should not be overlooked."}]}
