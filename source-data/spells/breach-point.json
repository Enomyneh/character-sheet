There is a significant difference, after all, between shooting through all of the moving parts inside a car door, and shooting through nothing more than a thin sheet of metal on one side, a bit of plastic one the other and nothing but empty air in between Each success of Potency assigned to this spell counts as an extra success of damage, solely for the purposes of overcoming the Durability of a piece of cover, making it that much easier for the willworker to cause harm to the target behind said cover with a ranged attack. Note that this cannot cause the attack afforded by successfully breaching the cover to benefit from more dice that would have been rolled were the cover not there in the first place.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Nowhere To Hide","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"No barrier can ward away the weapons and offensive magics of a dedicated Arrow.
