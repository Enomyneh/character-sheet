The caster's body becomes comatose as under the description of the Psychic Projection spell (although the mage can simply check in on his body if close by). While possessing another, the mage uses the Physical Attributes of his host, as well as any Merits or Flaws tied up in that individual's physical or social identity, but otherwise retains all of his own qualities. The willworker may choose to utterly suppress the host's consciousness or may keep it active as an impotent spectator. If the possessor tries to put the host in harm's way, a fresh reflexive and contested roll is made for the victim to break the possession (the new roll's successes must exceed the spell's).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Driving The Chariot","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Resolve + Gnosis","roteDescription":"Using another being as a \"horse\" (as the host of a possession is occasionally referred to), the Ladder willworker assumes that creature's identity and physical capabilities. Some use this magic to perform dangerous or illegal acts, while a rare few do so simply to illustrate the power they can exert over those who displease them."}]}
