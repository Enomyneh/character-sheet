The mage can also use this spell to cause all forms of damage to heal more rapidly. Each success allows the mage to halve the time (round down) it takes to heal bashing, lethal, and aggravated damage. 2 successes allow a mage to heal 1 lethal wound in 12 hours and 1 aggravated wound in a little over a day and a half. To gain this benefit, the mage must either cast this spell with the required duration or recast it whenever the duration expires. This healing is compatible with the Quick Healer Merit. Each success also acts as 1 automatic success on all extended and instant rolls to resist diseases, poisons, or drugs. Finally, characters who spend most of their time (at least 75%) under the influence of this spell lengthen their life spans by 25 years for every dot of the Life Arcana they possess. Decrease this latter bonus proportional to the amount of time the character spends using this spell. By spending 1 Mana, the Duration of this spell can be made to last for 1 day. Most mages who use this spell cast it at the beginning of the day, as part of their morning rituals.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Enduring Body","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"One of the greatest and most profound limitations of the life of all scholars and experimenters is the unavoidable combination of ill health and mortality that cuts short their ability to continue their research.
