When any owner other than the original worker of this spell attempts to dispose of it, a chain of coincidences conspires to return it. A smashed ceramic statue might be laboriously glued together by a building superintendent and returned with an expectation of gratitude. A DVD thrown out of a car window is found by the owner's best friend and given to him as a gift. When no possible further coincidence could possibly explain the item's return, it makes one final reappearance, shiny and new, after which point its owner is able to destroy or dispose of it. However, if that last disposal then opens up another possible coincidental return, the cycle continues.
