Rather, they sense nothing special about her and so are as apt to dismiss her presence as they are that of anyone else. On the street, they take no more notice of her than they would were she just a Sleeper, and are likely to forget ever having seen her soon thereafter. Each success adds to the difficulty of noticing or remembering the mage. Note that any blatantly attention-grabbing actions automatically violate the subtle occlusion of the spell. The spell affects anyone who witnesses the mage. It does not need special Target factors to affect more than one person. Those who possess some form of supernatural mental protection (such as a Mental Shield) are subject to a reflexive contested Gnosis + Mind roll upon first encountering the caster. If the roll's successes equal or exceed the Incognito Presence spell's successes, the onlooker can remember the mage normally.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Mask Of Mediocrity","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"With the mudra of salheyia (\"unimpressiveness\"), the mage using this rote may sneak about unnoticed, carefully placing himself where those who see him regard him as simply another part of the faceless crowd through which the mage stalks. In the Imago, the mage pulls a silk mask over his face and disappears utterly. Factor Bonuses: Wearing clothing that blends in with those in the environment (+1 factor)."}]}
