Despite the name, though, the spell isn't necessarily permanent. Students of the Last Riddle feel that this spell was a precursor to whatever magic currently enchants the grimoire, since that magic is considerably more potent than this spell. This spell functions on any single object up to Size 10. While this spell does function on machines, it renders them inoperable for the duration of the spell. The target number of successes is equal to twice the Size of the object, and the mage must expend Mana equal to the object's Structure. When the ritual is complete, the object remains in its current state for 1 scene. It cannot be altered, damaged, defaced, or repaired, though it can be moved. A gun imbued with this spell could not be fired, since no part of the object can be removed (and so the bullet could not leave the chamber). A car using this spell would not function, as doing so requires gasoline to be consumed, though a bicycle would function normally. A painting could not be marred or damaged even if tossed into a bonfire. Any attempted change to an object won't \"take\" -- fire ignores the painting, the magazine on the pistol won't eject. At Time 5, this spell can be cast with advanced Prolongation factors, allowing an Indefinite duration.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Orpheus' Last Riddle Rote","roteName":"Eternal Object","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"As the spell, above."}]}
