As an instant action, the item's owner can switch the two items, so that, for example, one's enchanted handgun disappears, to be replaced by its other half, an enhanced chainsaw. Aside from the convenience of carrying the two-in-one item, this spell allows both objects to benefit equally from any further curses, defenses or enhancements subsequently woven into the combined device. Additional castings of the spell allow for additional items to be added to the mix. Only one item exists in the Material Realm; all additional forms also go to the pocket dimension when not in use. Switching an object between forms evokes Disbelief in Sleeper witnesses.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"The Right Tool","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"Whether you're exploring an ancient crypt or creeping uninvited into a secret library, carrying capacity can be a critical issue.
