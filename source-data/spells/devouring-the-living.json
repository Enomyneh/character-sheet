Just as he is able to do with an ailing person under the shadow of death, the mage can now consume a fully healthy soul, one not touched with the taint of the grave, revitalizing his stores of Mana or stealing the victim's will. Likewise, he may devour any nearby ghost for its spiritual energies, augmenting himself in a similar manner. This spell is handled in exactly the same way as Devouring the Slain, save that the mage may now perform the spell upon a healthy subject (one not currently suffering from aggravated damage) or a nearby ghost (damaging the spirit's Corpus). The mage must still grab hold of the target first, however (unless he has Death 6, allowing him to cast the spell within sensory range as an instant action).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Spoils To The Victor","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","RoteDicePool_Resisted":"Stamina (living being) or Resistance (ghost)","roteDescription":"Let those who would lead the charge in battle be the first to sample victory's fruits. So goes the logic of the Adamantine Arrow, whose willworkers use this rote to destroy enemies, even as they restore reserves of both will and mystic power. Mages of the Silver Ladder also favor such magic, obliterating those who would express defiance through force of arms."}]}
