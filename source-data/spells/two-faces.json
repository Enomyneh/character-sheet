One feature may be altered per success. Each of the following is one feature: Changing eye color (includes both eyes), skin color, hair color, hair length, hair texture. Other superficial characteristics can also be altered: Fingers or toes may be slightly shortened or lengthened, body hair can be made sparse or more abundant, skin can be rendered dry or more oily, and height and weight can be very slightly altered (perhaps an inch or two, or up to 10 pounds, respectively). Perhaps most significantly, facial features and other distinguishing marks (like moles or scars) can be changed. Changes more extreme than these (such as changing fingerprints) require Life 4.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Incognito Exchange","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"With this rote, a Guardian can be someone other than himself, a useful ability in his line of work. Indeed, such a mage can go from a \"blond-haired, clean-shaven, green-eyed, early-30s\" suspect being chased by police to a 40ish man with salt-and-pepper hair and beard saying, \"He went that way.\" Silver Ladder willworkers sometimes use the same rote when trying to go unnoticed."}]}
