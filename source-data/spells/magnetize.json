Any object affected by this spell temporarily becomes a magnet. It begins with a Strength of zero; the object is mildly magnetic, but it cannot provide effective resistance against a creature that wants to move the object and may not be able to magnetically support its own weight. The Strength is increased by one per additional success. Note that some objects, even when strongly magnetized, cannot effectively use their Strength in all situations. Magnetizing a sheet of paper to Strength 5 may make it impossible to remove from the fridge, but the sheet will still rip if you slap it over the door to the fridge and the freezer and only open one of them.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Primagnet","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"Libertines use this rote to create powerful magnets out of anything that is at hand.
