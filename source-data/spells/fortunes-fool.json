Unfortunately for the bold, accidents still happen. With this spell, the mage learns to store misfortune and inflict it upon others, turning accident into opportunity. During a chapter, whenever the mage fails a roll, the mage may reflexively store that failure for later use. The mage may store a total number of failures equal to her Resolve, but only \"natural\" failures may be stored. Players may not choose to fail a roll in order to store it. The mage releases a failure by selecting a target and casting the spell. With a single success on the casting roll, the next action taken by that target fails automatically. Once a stored failure is spent, that failure is subtracted from the total. At the end of the chapter, any unused failures are lost.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Sorrows Shared","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"A good warrior finds a way to turn misfortune to his favor. The Adamantine Arrow developed this rote to transform missed opportunities into weapons to loose on their foes. Proper use of this rote requires some foresight. It does no good to inflict failure on an enemy just to see that failure manifest itself in a minor way."}]}
