The casting of this spell must begin within an hour of the target's death. This spell creates what some mages call a revenant, forcing the soul to inhabit a body that does not decompose for the duration of the spell. The caster inculcates the revenant with one or more driving Passions related to achieving a certain goal -- revenge, salvation -- that strengthen it for its trials. Only one success is required to animate a corpse and instill it with a Passion. Additional successes are added to the target number to boost the revenant's traits, at a rate of one success per additional dot of any trait. Although the target is dead, the Resolve Attribute it had in life is used to contest the magic. With Death 5, the caster can make a recently dead mage into a revenant, although the revenant can no longer cast magic. (It contests with Resolve + Gnosis.)","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Duty Before Rest","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","roteDescription":"Ladder mages often use this rote to raise to service those who have not yet fulfilled their debts, though some cast it for no reason other than that they need a loyal servant with exceptional capabilities and who is largely incapable of betrayal. Still, such castings are dangerous and potentially quite cruel, and can easily lead a mage away from the path of Wisdom."}]}
