Usually, it's not enough to make a difference, but sometimes -- just sometimes -- she manages to pull off the one-in-a-million stunt that saves the day. Of course, those with the power to manipulate the odds are often a little less hesitant about jumping into such \"hopeless situations.\" After successfully casting this spell, the mage treats the next chance roll she is called upon to make during the spell's Duration as having a die pool of one. This means that the willworker can succeed on a roll of eight through 10 (and benefit from such advantages as 8- or 9-again) and cannot dramatically fail the roll in question. Upon so modifying such a chance roll, the spell automatically expires, and the mage may not choose whether or not to apply the spell's effects to a given chance roll.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Better Lucky Than Good","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"John O'Dale, an Acanthus Arrow of some small fame among the Consilii scattered across the English countryside, was, among other things, an inveterate gambler. He loved to take all manner of ridiculous wagers to perform insanely improbable deeds -- preferably for considerable sums of money. While many of those who bet against him knew that he used magic to transform abject impossibilities into fighting chances, he was always entertaining enough about it and such a good sport on the frequent occasions upon which he still managed to fall short that no one complained much about it."}]}
