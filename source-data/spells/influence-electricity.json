He can, for example, cause an existing electrical current (such as that moving through appliances or in walls) to flash or arc out and strike a target. He could not amplify the current at this level. The mage does not directly attack a person or object with this spell; he instead manipulates an existing electrical current, redirecting it toward the target of his choice. The damage inflicted depends entirely on the electrical current. The raw power of the current is not altered in any way at this level. This spell usually causes the power source to shut down (a circuit breaker engages) or short out in following turn (although Duration factors can be increased to prevent this termination for additional turns). A simple success allows the electricity to affect one target. (The mage can arc the electricity to any target within five yards of the source per dot of Forces; a mage with Forces 2 can affect a target 10 yards away.) Excess successes  affect additional adjacent targets next to one another (this is an exception to the normal rule that disallows aimed spells to affect multiple targets). Targets must each be within three yards in either direction of each other. The source itself, however, limits the total number that can be affected.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"The Adamantine Arrow","roteName":"Shock Therapy","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Dexterity","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"Occasionally, a spark is all that's required.
