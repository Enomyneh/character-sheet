As with the Mind 5 Shadow Projection, Nightmare Journey creates fetters that bond the mage's consciousness back to his body. Instead of silver thread, however, iron chains enmesh his psychic body and wind through the bleak unreality of Abyssal consciousness, marking the path back to life and sanity. In game terms, these chains are identical to the silver cord created by Shadow Projection. The spell's effect usually lasts for one hour, but the mage's experiences within the horrid musings of the entity he encounters could haunt him much longer, or perhaps even forever. The mage gains no Investments from communing with the acamoth, but also does not suffer Willpower loss or degeneration: The Abyssal entity doesn't know the mage is there to tempt or torment -- unless the Fang's player rolls a dramatic failure during the spellcasting. In that case, the acamoth is quite aware of the psychic intruder and can make its customary offer.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Fangs Of Mara","roteName":"Bleak Sojourn","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"By means of this rote, Fangs of Mara make the Astral journey into the thoughts and dreams of the acamoth and other Abyssal entities, there to harness the maddening nightmares of things never meant for human minds to experience."}]}
