New clothing cannot be created, but existing clothes can be significantly altered: A pair of pants could become swim trunks or work overalls; a T-shirt might become a winter coat or a bra (or vice versa). The mage can choose to change some, all, or just one piece of clothing. Though the affected material looks like the real thing, the Durability, insulation, and other physical properties of the affected material don't change -- a tuxedo transformed into a HAZMAT suit won't offer special protection against chemicals, for example. Fine details such as badges or military insignia will be accurate enough to pass casual inspection, but anyone with the proper expertise will spot the fake upon close examination and an instant Wits + Investigation roll.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Quick Change","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"Sometimes a Guardian needs to move from one setting to another as quickly as possible; with this spell, he can be properly attired to blend in with any crowd.
