The mage can shore up or degrade the Durability of such ephemera, and the item can be reshaped, changing a heap of metal into a bicycle frame or a stick into a spear. The mage cannot affect animate ephemera, such as a nature spirit or a fetch. Doing that requires Spirit. Only one success is needed to reshape an object (if the new shape is very complex, the Storyteller might levy dice penalties to the casting). Or, one point of Durability is added per success. In the case of weapons or armor, successes can also be assigned to a weapon's equipment bonus or to armor's protection.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Spirit-Smithing","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Dexterity","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"Mysterium willworkers often use this rote to craft useful objects before drawing them out of the Shadow Realm and into the material world.
