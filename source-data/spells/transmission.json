While this spell gives the caster the ability to replace one signal with another, it doesn't convey the skill or talent needed to fake a specific transmission. That requires Skills appropriate to the transmission, which could be Expression, Subterfuge, and even Science. The Storyteller decides what roll needs to be made to devise a convincing transmission. For example, faking a radio transmission by a well-known radio shock-jock would require the ability to mimic that DJ's voice, which might be Intelligence + Expression, assuming the speaker's voice isn't too unlike the person's mimicked.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Voices In The Ether","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Good for sending police on wild-goose chases and creating scares about Martian invasions, among many other uses, this Mysterium rote is also quite popular with Guardians of the Veil, who cherish its potential for misdirection."}]}
