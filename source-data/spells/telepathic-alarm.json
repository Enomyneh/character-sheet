The owner senses the interloper's identity and can read his conscious thoughts. She may beam her own thoughts into the interloper's brain (in Sleepers, this triggers Disbelief). The connection establishes sympathy between owner and interloper, which, if he knows Space 2, allows the owner to cast spells at the interloper from a distance.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Breath On The Back Of Your Neck","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Weaving this into an item requires at least +5 successes on the target number. On +10 successes, the item's owner can choose to restrict the telepathic link to a one-way communication, in which the interloper remains unaware of the psychic eavesdropping."}]}
