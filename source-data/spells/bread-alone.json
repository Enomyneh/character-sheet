With this spell, a magician can turn the handfuls of creepy-crawlies and otherwise inedible plant matter he might find around him into plain and yet nutritious and easily stored blocks of food matter. The food created is tasty, but just as with any food, too much of it can get boring. The spell requires base life matter to be available and in hand. In a forest, the mage might be able to find tree leaves, slugs, snails, beetles, worms and the like. In the desert, cacti, beetles and scorpions might fit the bill. On the open sea, the mage may have to scoop up algae and plankton. The mage needs to kill the animals (or pick the plant matter) he's going to use as ingredients before he casts this spell. Successes are allocated to Potency: each point of Potency creates enough food for one meal for one person.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Crabsticks","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Survival","roteDescription":"There are stories of Free Council sailors found adrift on lifeboats for weeks on end without any food.
