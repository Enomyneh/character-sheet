{"name":"Preserve Astral Space","sourceBook":"Astral Realms","sourcePage":"25","primaryArcana":"Mind","arcanaRequirement":"Mind 3","requirements":[{"name":"Mind","dots":"3"}],"practice":"Weaving","action":"Instant","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Covert","cost":"None","effect":"The astral is a dangerous and interesting place, but one that shifts rapidly. When a mage needs respite from the dangers or needs extra time to explore a dream space, this spell delays her departure. This spell affects an area one-yard in radius, protecting everything within that radius from changing at the whim of Astral Space. This creates unexpected interactions when all but a small portion of a set piece whisks away or has changed when the astral traveler returns; Awakened psychologists prize this spell for its ability to juxtapose different facets of an Oneiros for interaction and comparison. While similar to Preserve Astral Object, this spell is not mobile -- an object taken out of the affected area is subject to the realm's normal laws. If an object's connected set piece has already disappeared, it disappears (or changes shape) immediately upon removal.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Bastion","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Survival","roteDescription":"No Adamantine Arrow enjoys being behind enemy lines, and traveling through Astral Space that can change shape without warning and leave a mage surrounded by hostile creatures with no way out is as far behind enemy lines as one can get. This rote produces a base of operations, a place the mage can be sure won't abandon him. Mysterium mages have a similar rote (Intelligence + Academics + Mind) they use to create repositories of knowledge within their own Oneiroi, keeping the repositories safe from external examination and from being washed away by dream tides."}]}
