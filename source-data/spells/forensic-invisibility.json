Rapid decay obliterates fibers, dead skin, hair, saliva, and all other detritus. She leaves behind fine, sterile ash that scatters in the slightest breeze. The spell also destroys the mage's fingerprints by eliminating skin oils, but won't affect marks she's left in powders or other substances capable of retaining an impression. The spell won't eliminate evidence that the mage leaves by disturbing the surrounding environment, such as footprints or objects that she's moved or broken.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Humble Exit","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Stealth","roteDescription":"A Moros Banisher recently taught this rote to members of St. Michael's Promise (see Boston Unveiled) because he thought they'd need it in a city so infested by sorcery. The Banisher concentrates on humbling himself before God, reminding himself to leave no sign of pride, lest a subconscious desire to take credit for his work give him away to the authorities."}]}
