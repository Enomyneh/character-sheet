This is as the Death 1 Grim Sight spell, except that the mage casts it upon another mage or even a supernatural being such as a ghost or werewolf.

Those who have never before glimpsed the heavy shadow of Death are often changed by the experience. It is for this reason that Adamantine Arrow mages also make use of this magic (Presence + Persuasion + Death), so that none can forget the heavy burden that their order has accepted."}]}
