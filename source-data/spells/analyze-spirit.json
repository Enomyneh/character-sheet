This spell allows the mage to both see and analyze a spirit in Twilight. If the mage also casts the Spirit 2 spell Peer Across the Gauntlet, she can also use the Analyze Spirit spell to analyze nearby spirits in the Shadow Realm. A single success on this spell allows the mage to determine a spirit's Rank and most significant Influence, and also provides a rough estimate of the spirit's current Essence as well as the spirit's general appearance. Additional successes provide further information, including an increasingly precise knowledge of the spirit's Attributes, additional Influences, the level of its various Influences and (with three or more successes) knowledge of its more significant or powerful Numina. This spell provides no knowledge about the activities or history of a particular spirit, merely its capabilities. If the caster adds Mind 1 to the casting, she can also use this spell to gain information about individuals who are mentally projecting, and if she adds Death 1, she can gain similar information about ghosts.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium","roteName":"Ephemeral Classification","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The Mysterium's central maxim of \"Knowledge Is Power\" is never more true than when dealing with the strange and potentially deadly residents of the Shadow Realm.
