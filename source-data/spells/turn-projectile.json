Although the casting is an instant action, the mage can cast this spell at any point in the Initiative roster, even before he could normally act, although that is his action for the turn. The mage can turn the projectile up, down, right, left, or even back the way it came. The degree to which the projectile's course is altered depends on the number of successes rolled. Mages can mix and match successes to direct a projectile's course in multiple directions. For example, with two successes, a mage can turn an arrow 45 degrees to its left and then make it go down 45 degrees from its new course. The effect is lasting; once the projectile's course is altered, it remains traveling along its new course until something else causes it to change vectors or it smashes into something. With a successful reflexive Dexterity + Firearms roll, the mage can aim the projectile at a target along its new trajectory. The mage can affect multiple projectiles by adding extra Target factors. When turning autofire from the same gun, use the following special autofire dice penalties chart.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
