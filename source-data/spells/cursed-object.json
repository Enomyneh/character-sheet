The Potency of this spell cannot exceed the caster's total Fate dots. To weave the curse into the item, she must spend one Mana and add five successes to the target number of the spell. Whenever the user touches or makes use of the cursed item, the possibility of ill luck arises. (For this reason, it is essential that the mage installing the curse get rid of the item as soon as possible afterwards; until it changes hands, she counts as its owner.) The Storyteller rolls a single die; on a result of one, the curse activates, and the victim suffers a penalty to his next die roll equal to the Potency of the curse. In some cases, the Storyteller may have to determine precisely which activities qualify as use of an item. In the case of an art object, for example, a roll may be required whenever the owner takes a moment to admire it.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"The Monkey's Cell Phone","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Despite this rote's grimly jocular name, this curse can be cast on any communication device."}]}
