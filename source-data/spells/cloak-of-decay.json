Each attack, successful or not, wears at weapons until attackers find their swords shattered, their knives dulled, and their spears broken. Each time the mage is attacked with a melee weapon (including improvised melee weapons), roll dice of damage equal to spell Potency against that weapon. Even entering the area created by Cloak of Decay can cause damage to weaponry. A damage roll is made against an attacker's weapon even if the attack misses. This spell has no effect on ranged weapons or on any type of bare-fisted Brawling attack.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Entropic Armor","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts or Science","roteDescription":"Application of strategy in battle is just as important as application of force. Many warriors train extensively in one area of combat and, if denied the opportunity to use that training, are quickly defeated. When confronted with an opponent who shows expertise with a particular weapon, use of this spell can disarm and demoralize them."}]}
