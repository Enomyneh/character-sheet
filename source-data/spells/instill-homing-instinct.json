The item moves of its own volition through a gateway in space, as if by an Apportation spell. The Apportation effect triggers when the item has been out of the owner's possession for a period of time determined by the spell's Potency. Disbelief is triggered in Sleepers who witness the Apportation effect.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
