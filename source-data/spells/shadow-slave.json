Some mages choose to stuff a corpse with these oozing shadows, animating the inert flesh with living darkness, while others use no crude mortal shell to contain the roiling blackness. Successes must be used to grant Physical Attributes, Wits, Skills and points of armor (on a one-for-one basis) to the shadow creation (regardless of whether or not it inhabits a corpse). It possesses one dot in Intelligence and Presence, and zero in Composure, Manipulation and Resolve. It knows no fear and, as an only marginally sentient entity, is not subject to mind control or any effect that is contested by Composure and/or Resolve. The entity, while itself nearly mindless, is fettered to the mage's will, performing even complicated tasks with aplomb (like firing a pistol or punching numbers into a keypad in a certain sequence). The mage gives it commands as an instant action, but only one task at a time.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Call To Darkness","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","roteDescription":"Unthinking obedience and a terrifying presence combine in this Silver Ladder rote to create a fantastically efficient servitor.
