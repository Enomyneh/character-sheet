Those  who are knowledgeable in the ways of the spirit realm may be able to identify what sort of spirit inhabits a given individual, but such information is not necessarily conveyed by this spell. If a spirit has the ability to hide and wishes to do so, it may use such a power and pit its own successes directly against this spell's successes (the spell's Potency) in an attempt to remain hidden.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Parting The Shadow","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The Guardians of the Veil have cataloged a wide variety of phenomena that are known to suddenly and inexplicably change a person's demeanor, often into something frightening and alien. One of the more common paranormal causes is possession, whether on the part of a ghost, a spirit or something else entirely. This rote enables a Guardian to detect the presence of an ephemeral entity \"riding\" a host. Mages of the Mysterium use the same rote when searching out possession in the course of their work."}]}
