By accepting the hurts of Paradox into one's own flesh, however, Plures believed the Abyss could be denied greater purchase in the Fallen World. This spell enables just that, allowing the Guardian to draw Paradox into his own living pattern, thus preventing the taint of the Abyss from further infecting this world. Upon successfully casting this spell -- which can be done reactively in response to any form of Paradox in the mage's vicinity, save backlash, so long as he has not yet taken his action for the turn -- the Guardian draws the force of a Paradox into his own body. He then rolls the Paradox successes as a Backlash dice pool, suffering its effects, if any, as normal. Note that the Guardian may, if he wishes, use Mana to mitigate the Paradox before rolling for backlash. Note that this spell may not be cast on another, whether willingly or otherwise.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Taming The Void","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Reaching out with this magic, the Guardian seizes hold of the power of the Abyss and, through personal suffering, defies and negates it.
