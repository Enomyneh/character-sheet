Some mages perceive auras as a series of colors, while others describe them in terms of musical notes, odors, tastes or other purely non-physical senses. See the chart below for specifics. Note that this spell does not allow a mage to read a target's nature. That requires the \"Supernal Vision\" spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"The Adamantine Arrow","roteName":"Know The Wolf By His Stance","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Empathy","roteDescription":"In nature, most creatures give their emotional state away through a combination of body posture, facial expression and other physiological cues (such as musk or excessive saliva). Humans have learned to suppress many of these cues for the sake of \"polite\" social interaction, but a mage of the Adamantine Arrow can look past these civilized contrivances and read an individual's true intent. Willworkers of the Silver Ladder are also known to employ this rote; the power to control a person through understanding of her emotions is not to be underestimated."},{"roteOrder":"Theosophy Tradition","roteName":"Etheric Lens","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Empathy","roteDescription":"The mage sees without seeing, closing his eyes for a moment and concentrating on the individual in front of him.
