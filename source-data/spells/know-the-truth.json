The newspapers don't always tell the truth. A Tamer of Winds, however, knows that the truth is written on the air, and using the magic of Time, can call the winds back to ascertain whether a written or printed document, a piece of film or a photograph or drawing is true. When a Tamer of Winds casts this spell successfully, she knows whether a document is true. This is more subtle than a simple facts/falsehood dichotomy. A photograph that has not been doctored in any way can be said to lie (consider a convincing-looking photo of a UFO, composed in such a way so as to obscure the fact that the \"huge alien craft\" is in fact an airborne hubcap with some bits of plumbing equipment stuck to it). A news report can give a complete rundown of the facts, but can still give a false impression in the way that it organizes the facts.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Freeing The Text","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"\"Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.\" The mages of the Mysterium know that.
