But \"lost\" is not the same as \"destroyed.\" With the right knowledge of sympathetic connections, what was lost may be found again. By casting this spell, a mage can reconstruct the Final Name of someone already dead. In order to properly reconstruct the Name, the mage must acquire Known or better sympathetic connections to at least 10 objects or individuals who had sympathetic connections to the deceased. Possessing the objects in question or the Final Names of the individuals is also adequate. For every connection less than ten, the mage suffers a -1 penalty to her casting pool. If she has no connections at all, she cannot cast the spell. Successes rolled on the spellcasting pool determine the maximum \"age\" (that is, time since death) of the Final Name the mage can restore, using the Prolonged Duration chart. If the mage attempts to recreate the Final Name of someone who has been dead longer than the indicated Duration, the spell fails. If the mage has Death 3, she may use the Advanced Prolongation chart to determine the maximum age of the Final Name. \"Indefinite\" Duration means that the mage can restore the Final Name of any deceased individual, as long as the mage has the appropriate sympathetic resonances.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Rebuild The Shattered Tombstone","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The Stone Scribes consider the loss of any true name a tragedy, and take steps to recover those lost to time."}]}
