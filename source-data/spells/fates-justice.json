This spell preemptively invokes Fate to curse the subject of the spell immediately before the subject takes a particular action, usually a hostile action against someone (such as the caster). The power of the spell then intervenes to frustrate the attempt and bring ill-fortune on the would-be perpetrator. Success works similar to The Evil Eye: Subtracting dice equal to the caster's Fate dots from the subject's dice pool for the next action taken. Each additional success affects an additional dice roll. The effect begins immediately before the action (and therefore die roll) that triggers it.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Equal And Opposite","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"This techn&eacute; treats the forces of Fate as any other set of opposing forces: Push in one direction, and the opposing force pushes back in the other.
