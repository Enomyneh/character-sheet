Some Awakened could not agree more. This spell deadens the body's pain responses and terminates circulation and respiration without deleterious effects, as well as bestowing one or two other interesting advantages. Upon successfully casting this spell, and for the remainder of the scene, the mage no longer suffers wound penalties, does not need to breathe, and does not begin to bleed to death when all of his Health boxes are filled with lethal damage. Likewise, he does not register as a living pattern to sensory magic (though Life Arcanum spells can still affect him and he doesn't count as a walking corpse for the purposes of the Death Arcanum), and perhaps most spectacularly, he can reattach severed pieces of his body with Life Arcanum healing (at the appropriate level for the type of damage sustained in losing the limb, or whatever other part was removed), so long as it is done before this spell's Duration expires.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Reaper's Aegis","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","roteDescription":"Arrows die, so that others need not.
