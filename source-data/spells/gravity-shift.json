No matter -- with this spell, the caster isn't limited to walking on the ground. He can amble up the side of a wall or stride across a ceiling avoiding obstructions that would slow the passage of earthbound travelers.With each success, the mage can shift the direction of gravity upon his person by 45 degrees. Thus, one success allows him to scale a vertical wall with mild effort, as if it were a steep incline; two successes allows him to walk straight up it as if it was flat ground. Four successes are needed to walk on a ceiling (after walking up the wall to reach it). From the mage's perspective, \"down\" always feels as if it's beneath his feet, and everything he carries or holds behaves accordingly. He could even pour himself a glass of water while standing on the ceiling, and the water would fall into his glass instead of spilling onto the floor. Once he lets go of something --including another person, if he's carrying someone -- that item or person is affected by gravity normally. Note that the mage need not be in motion for the spell to function; he could choose to sit on a ceiling like a spider while guarding a room, for example.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Human Fly","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"With this rote, no wall is too high to climb.
