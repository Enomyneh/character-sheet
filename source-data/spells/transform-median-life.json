The mage can affect a target of Size 20 or less. If the target is larger, penalties are levied against the spellcasting roll. He transforms the target into a creature of Size typical for that type of being. A bear (Size 8) can be transformed into a cat (Size 2), but not into a Size 8 cat. Transforming a smaller creature (the cat) into a larger creature (the bear) imposes dice penalties. At this level, the mage must touch the target. With Life 4, he can cast this spell at sensory range.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
