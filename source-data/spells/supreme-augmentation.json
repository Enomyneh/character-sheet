It takes a long time to do (it's always a ritual casting). The mage needs to meditate in his sanctum and needs to avoid all other contact. He adopts a comfortable position and trains his third eye on the center of his being, before thrusting his perception outwards towards the God-principle at the center of everything, linking himself with the whole. If successful, he becomes aware of his own Augoeides as a shining figure at the corner of his perception, which separates from him, and then merges again. The wisdom of dozens of past lives floods to the mage's surface consciousness, allowing him to access greater psychic reserves than he normally could use."}]}
