The mage must declare before casting whether successes apply to the force's Strength (its lifting ability) or Dexterity (its fine manipulation ability). The lesser Attribute has a default score of 1 dot. The caster can also raise either Attribute by choosing to suffer a -1 dice penalty on the spellcasting roll per dot to be raised. She could, for example, choose to put a lot of Strength and very little Dexterity into a spell intended to lift an extremely heavy object straight up, or she could grant very little Strength and a lot of Dexterity to a spell cast to use a set of lock picks from a distance (roll the Telekinesis Dexterity + caster's Larceny Skill). The object cannot be moved beyond the mage's sight (unless he uses Space 2 to scry it). The mage can move the item at a Speed per turn equal to his Gnosis + Forces. The mage must concentrate for each turn. With Forces 4, he can cast the spell with a default Duration of one scene (in which case, when he is not actively manipulating the object, it stays where he left it, even levitating in the air).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Hand Of The Mind","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult or Science","roteDescription":"Guardians armed with this rote can distract Sleeper interlopers with all manner of sounds, or quiet their own noises should a Sleeper approach."}]}
