While some mages uphold that ancient practice, this spell is intended for a decidedly different purpose. The caster seeks to deceive nearby ephemeral entities into believing that she is one of them. Upon successfully casting this spell, the mage projects the subtle qualities of a ghost (with Death), a Shadow Realm spirit (Spirit), or both (with a combination of the two Arcana). Her outward appearance in no ways changes, unless altered by other means, but entities of the appropriate type who fail to contest the spell's effects simply regard her as being of a similar nature, while she is under the effects of this spell; she doesn't register as anyone or anything out of the ordinary. In this manner, a willworker might travel effectively unnoticed by the unseen things of the world.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Wearing The False Face","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"In the course of fulfilling his order's obligations, a Guardian of the Veil must often walk in secrecy and silence, unobserved by all. The Fallen World, however, teems with entities that populate the invisible layers of the Tapestry. In concealing himself from these beings -- walking among them as though he were one of them -- the Guardian hides in plain sight."}]}
