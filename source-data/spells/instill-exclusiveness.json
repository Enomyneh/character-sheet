Unauthorized users may still be targeted by the item's other defensive enchantments, if any. The mage may, at the time of casting, exempt any of the item's magical properties from the purview of this spell. An item's enhancements are often exempted; exclusiveness would otherwise make the item less durable when handled by enemies intent on destroying it. A spell that has not yet been cast on the item at the time Instill Exclusiveness is woven into it is automatically exempted from its effect.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Rights Of Property","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Guardians rankle at the thought of grubby outsider hands making profitable use of their precious Enchanted Items."}]}
