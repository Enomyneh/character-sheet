This techn&eacute; is much as Psychic Projection except rather then entering Twilight, the mage's consciousness travels into a representation of a computer network or networks in the Fallen World. The mage's virtual form has no Corpus, just a visualized virtual image that can be affected only by mind-affecting powers. The mage appears to be in a deep sleep or trance while the consciousness is on the virtual voyage. If desired, the caster can apply an extra Targets factor to bring others along on the voyage.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Jacking In","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Computers or Science","roteDescription":"Free Council \"reality hackers\" have long believed that this techn&eacute; accesses a \"machine consciousness\" or a Twilight \"shadow\" of the Fallen World's computer networks, proof that the mundane works of humanity have a kind of magic to them, and that there are deeper connections and mysteries for the Awakened to explore and understand. The rapid spread and growth of computer technology in modern culture has only made the techn&eacute; more useful (and easier to conceal)."}]}
