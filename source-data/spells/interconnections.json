In other words, the caster can read the degree of sympathetic connection between subjects. The mage can also sense manipulations of destiny and their causes. This ability extends to any supernatural effect that will or might result in a person's destiny unfolding in a manner different from that in which it is \"meant\" to. Success allows the mage to examine anyone in sensory range to determine the interconnections they might have with each other (or even with things and institutions, such as corporate brands or fashions). On each turn following the casting of this spell (so long as the mage continues to concentrate), an extended Wits + Empathy + Fate roll can be made for the mage to scrutinize people. Each success yields some information, with more successes yielding more powerful or secret connections. The mage cannot tell exactly what the connections mean, just their intensity. If the target has any form of supernatural occlusion (such as the Occultation Merit) that would hinder the mage's perception, the caster's dice pool is modified by the dots or Potency of that protection.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
