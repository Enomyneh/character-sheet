This spell cannot be cast with indefinite Duration (unlike the basic Great Curse effect), so as to prevent an outbreak of evil luck that eventually grows to encompass the world. While the spell's initial target is not allowed active resistance to the curse, subsequent potential targets contest the spell's effect with a roll of Composure + Gnosis.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"A Plague On Your House","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","roteDescription":"Some persistent Sleepers just don't respond well to threats against their own health, but, when you add in a threat to the well-being of their family and friends, many change their tunes. Guardians use this magic to curse those outsiders that delve too deeply into the Mysteries, making them a source of pain and misfortune for their loved ones and, indeed, everyone they associate with."}]}
