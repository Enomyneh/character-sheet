The caster gains temporary dots in a particular Skill, chosen when the spell is cast, one Skill dot per success, up to a maximum of the mage's Mind Arcanum dots. Thus a mage with Mind 3 can gain up to three dots in a Skill using this spell. All the dots must be in the same Skill, and Skills cannot increase above five dots in this manner (but see the Skill Mastery spell for a version where they can). While the spell is in effect, the mage has full normal use of the additional Skill. When the spell ends, the Skill dots, and any capabilities that came with them, disappear. This may even result in the mage no longer understanding his or her own work! Because this spell lasts for one scene, this spell is of only limited use in performing extended actions.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Fast-Learner","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"The days when a Renaissance Man could know everything there is to know are long past, and members of the Free Council know it. Still, that doesn't mean they can't fill in the gaps in their knowledge and experience from time to time. Many contemporary Libertines believe this spell taps into the Astral depths of the universal consciousness to imbue the caster with knowledge imprinted there by countless other minds. Whether the spell touches upon morphic fields or the Akashic Records, the effect is the same."}]}
