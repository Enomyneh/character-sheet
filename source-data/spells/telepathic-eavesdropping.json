A mage must have the Mind 1 Third Eye spell active in order to use this spell, or else she cannot see the mystical waves of thought well enough to target them. Once successful, the mage perceives every conscious thought sent across a mental link created by Mind 3 Telepathy, Mind 5 Network, or a similar spell or power. Completely unidirectional links, such as those used in reading memories or telepathic control, cannot be tapped by this spell. In order for the person or people being spied upon to notice the intrusion, they must also have active Third Eye spells. Mages with this benefit are allowed a Wits + Composure roll to notice the tap; this roll is penalized by one die for each success the caster rolled to activate this spell. With Mind 4, a mage can cast this spell with a prolonged Duration. With Mind 5, she can use advanced-prolonged Duration factors.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Mind Tap","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Empathy","roteDescription":"This rote hails back to the original Eye of the Dragon on the isle of Atlantis.
