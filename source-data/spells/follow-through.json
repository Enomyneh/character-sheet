He can follow such a doorway only to its original terminus. In other words, the mage using this spell has no choice but to go exactly where the previous spatial door went. This limitation can obviously prove to be quite problematic if the passage leads to, say, a room full of heavily armed men or an active volcano. The mage suffers penalties based on distance as if he were scrying. Successes apply to the Duration factor, which must equal or exceed the time elapsed since the door was opened. For example, the spell requires a Duration factor of four successes to open a portal that has been closed for 24 hours (with Space 3, four successes covers doors that were opened up to one month ago).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Spatial Burglary","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Dexterity","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"All things in the physical world may serve as a symbol of some action or activity in the magical realms. Even something as mundane as picking a lock to a door might serve in this function -- a knowledgeable lockpick who discovers where a spatial rift has recently been opened might be able to pry that portal back open, given sufficient time and skill, as well as magical prowess. In the Imago, the mage pulls power down the Pandemonaic Watchtower and directs it through his lock picking instruments, which rip open the doorway with a demonic shriek. Factor Bonuses: Using a set of lock picks (+1 factor)."}]}
