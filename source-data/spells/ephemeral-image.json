These creations possess no substance at all; they are simply flat images that must be overlaid upon some existing surface. However, using this spell the mage can change the color or pattern of a suit, the picture and written information on an ID card, the appearance of a photograph, or even the apparent value of a piece of currency. The mage could also attempt to disguise a blank piece of paper as a valuable oil painting, but anyone touching it would feel smooth modern paper and not rough and aging paint. This spell can change the appearance of the surface of any item of Size 5 or less. The mage must make an Intelligence + Crafts or Intelligence + Expression roll (depending upon the nature of the image being created) to create the desired appearance. Excess successes on the casting roll each add 1 die to this roll. This spell cannot affect the texture, size or shape of an object, only the colors, patterns, pictures or text on its surface.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Ethereal Disguise","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Whether they wish to ensure they are wearing the height of fashion or are attempting to impersonate someone by using an ID with the person's name and their picture, this spell can be an invaluable tool for mages engaged in any form of intrigue."}]}
