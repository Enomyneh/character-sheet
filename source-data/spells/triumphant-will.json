Alternately, such a magus might place years of social interaction at the forefront of his mind, drawing conclusions about the behaviors and the best way to influence those around him in a hundred different ways. For each success on the spellcasting roll, the mage gains one use of the rote action ability on any skill in either the Mental Skill or Social Skill lists -- the category of Skills must be chosen when the spell is cast. This may only be used on non-magical Skill rolls. At Mind 5, the mage may grant this ability to others by touch. At Mind 5, the mage may also cast a version of this spell that allows him to use both Mental and Social Skills with a single casting of the spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium","roteName":"Powerful Recollection","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Invoking the powerful names of various gods of learning and knowledge, the Mysterium scholar literally takes all knowledge to be his province.
