Complicated items such as mechanical devices might be made more or less efficient through the careful manipulation of the quality of their inner workings. Equipment modifiers can be increased or decreased by one die per success (to a maximum limit of plus or minus five dice). A vehicle's maximum speed can be increased or decreased by 10 mph per success (max: Plus or minus 50 mph), or its acceleration can be increased or decreased by five per success (max: Plus or minus 25).
