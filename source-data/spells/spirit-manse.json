The target number of successes is based on the volume of the manse. See the Area-Affecting chart in Spellcasting 101 for extended spellcasting. The caster also adds one success to the target number per point of Durability of the outer wall (on a one-point-per-success basis). Ordinary features (a normal chair or a bookshelf) are woven out of ephemera and require no successes to create. Exceptional features (an elaborate pair of golden double doors or a fountain or glittering crystal) require one or more successes, depending on their size. The mage can control who comes or goes from his manse. All others must forcibly breach the walls to get in. The mage can increase Duration using the advanced prolonged Duration factors.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Spirit Sanctum","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"With this rote, a Mysterium mage can craft a stronghold far from the prying eyes of ordinary mortals.
