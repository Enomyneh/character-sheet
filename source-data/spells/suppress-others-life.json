The effects are the same as the Suppress Own Life spell. The mage must first grab hold of the target, with a Strength or Dexterity + Brawl - the target's Defense. If successful, he can cast this spell reflexively. (With Death 5, he can cast this spell at sensory range. He needs Death 6 before he can add Space 2 for a sympathetic casting.) If the target is attacked or harmed in any way during the time in which he appears to be dead, the spell is immediately broken and the target awakens. While \"dead,\" the target experiences nothing, as if he were merely in a deep sleep.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Consign To The Mausoleum","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Composure + Gnosis","roteDescription":"When all else fails and a Guardian of the Veil has no wish to actually end the life of a problematic Sleeper, she can use this rote to make him seem to be dead temporarily. She then acquires the \"corpse\" and helps to ease the individual into a new life elsewhere. Arrow mages in war-torn areas sometimes cast this rote to help allies infiltrate an enemy's lair."}]}
