Some mages have learned how to make their bodies fireproof, by manipulating the air around their bodies in such a way that fire cannot harm them. The mage who casts this spell is proof against small fires. With the three-dot version of this spell, he can cast it on others. Like the Forces 2 Unseen Shield spell, Fireproofing allows the mage a degree of armor against fire damage (equal to one point of armor per dot of Forces). Even if he is not in direct contact with the flame, its heat does not bother him, unless it's hotter (in terms of damage inflicted per turn) than his Forces dots, in which case he suffers any excess damage due to heat prostration. In addition, his clothing and any object he holds becomes fireproof, no matter how flammable they might be (the fuse on a stick of dynamite can't catch fire so long as he holds it).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Asbestos Skin","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Survival","roteDescription":"If you play with fire, you're going to get burned.
