A simple success gives gravity a Strength of 1 and affects a five-square-yard area. Excess successes are allocated between the Strength of the gravity and the area affected. Each point of Strength subtracts three points from the Speed of anyone  or anything within the volume affected. Those affected also suffer a -1 dice penalty to jumping rolls per Strength. Additionally, if the gravity's Strength exceeds a person's Strength, all Physical dice pools are at -1 dice per excess Strength. Flying creatures (including those using Forces spells to fly or that are lifted telekinetically) are subject to a reflexive Strength + Athletics roll each turn. Failure in any roll forces them toward the ground at a rate of Speed per turn equal to the gravity's Strength.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
