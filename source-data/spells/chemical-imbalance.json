The mage does not have the deftness to precisely alter a target's brain chemistry and achieve emotional result. (Though, at Life 4, specific emotions can be created through the manipulation of brain and body chemistry.) The results of this spell may cause effects similar to that of intoxication, manic depression, high or low testosterone levels or general unruliness paired with vertigo. The specific effects depend on the caster's successes.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
