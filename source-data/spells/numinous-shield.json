The mage gains one point of armor per dot he possesses in the Spirit Arcanum. By spending one Mana, the Duration can be made to last for one day. This armor works against only spirit powers, such as Numina and werewolf Gifts and rituals. A Numinous Shield requires one Mana each time it contends with an incoming power. If the mage does not (or cannot) allocate the Mana, the shield provides no armor against the attacking power, although the shield remains until its Duration expires, so it can be activated later. Among other things, this spell allows a mage to use a Numinous Shield selectively, blocking hostile powers but allowing friendly powers through. Mages often invest their shields with charges, spending Mana during casting so that each charge already stores its own energy. In addition, the mage can use a counterspell to prevent a spirit power from taking effect.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Ephemeral Ward","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"An invaluable asset to the Adamantine Arrow willworker anticipating hostile attention from spirits, this rote guards against the paranormal abilities of such beings in the same way that the Prime Arcanum wards against magic. Silver Ladder mages use similar magics (Composure + Occult + Spirit) when aware of an ephemeral threat."}]}
