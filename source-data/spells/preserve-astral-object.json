They come and go with a realm's dreamlike transitions, here one moment and gone the next. Sometimes, an astral object is too important to let go. It might be an object with an important sympathetic connection, or maybe it's just a gun the mage wants to level against a native later on. Or the mage has created something potent in his Oneiros that he wants to carry into the Temenos. This spell makes all that possible. If the spell is successful, the target object remains in the same scene as the mage despite shifting set pieces. The mage can leave it behind and expect to return to it, even if the realm changes a great deal in the Duration, though finding it isn't always easy. Carrying the object with him, the mage knows that it will not suddenly disappear. Also, the mage may transition into another astral stratum (from the Temenos into the Anima Mundi, for example) and bring the object with him.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Quantum State Preservation","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"Mages find the most interesting examples of psychosis in Oneiroi, and the symbols born from sick intentions found in the deeper astral realms are incredibly fascinating. Free Council psychologists who explore Astral Space (especially Jungians in the Temenos) use this rote for extra time to study their findings. The Mysterium has a similar rote (Intelligence + Occult + Mind) they use for the same purpose."}]}
