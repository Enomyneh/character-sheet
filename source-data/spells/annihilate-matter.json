{"name":"Annihilate Matter","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"201","primaryArcana":"Matter","arcanaRequirement":"Matter 4","requirements":[{"name":"Matter","dots":"4"}],"practice":"Unraveling","action":"Instant","duration":"Lasting","aspect":"Vulgar","cost":"None","effect":"The mage can destroy inert matter, reducing it to nothingness and utterly dissolving its atomic lattice. In effect, he makes it cease to be. A material's hardness or density does not appreciably factor into this destruction; only sheer quantity (in terms of cubic volume) really has much bearing on the process. Each success inflicts one point of damage on an object, without the need to overcome the object's Durability. The exception is for magical items, such as enhanced or imbued items or Artifacts, or supernatural compounds and alloys. They cannot be destroyed with this spell, although the Matter 5 Annihilate Extraordinary Matter spell can affect them.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Disintegration","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult or Science","roteDescription":"On occasion, protecting lives involves breaking things. Sometimes an Arrow mage needs to get heavy debris off of someone quickly, or must break through a wall, annihilate a weapon, or destroy an animate pile of lifeless matter. Guardians of the Veil use the same rote in the course of their work as well."}]}
