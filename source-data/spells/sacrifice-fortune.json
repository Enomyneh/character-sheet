This spell is cast immediately after the mage scores an exceptional success. The Storyteller may rule that exceptional successes at attempts of little relevance to the ongoing narrative do not qualify; only events of significant import or risk generate sufficient resonance to activate this effect. Also disqualified are actions in which an exceptional success provides no particular additional benefit, above that of an ordinary success. The exceptional success is downgraded to a standard simple success, and the mage adds one to a pool of points known as the Sacrifice Fortune pool. The mage may at any subsequent time relinquish control over a finishing spell, by paying seven points from his Sacrifice Fortune pool.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Point Shaving","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The fl ashier risk-takers of the Free Council enjoy the show-boating nature of this rote, which allows them to simultaneously squander and profit from their grander successes."}]}
