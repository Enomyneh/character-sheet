{"name":"Induce Vertigo","sourceBook":"Banishers","sourcePage":"58","primaryArcana":"Life","arcanaRequirement":"Life 3","requirements":[{"name":"Life","dots":"3"}],"practice":"Fraying","action":"Instant","duration":"Transitory (one turn)","aspect":"Covert","cost":"None","effect":"The mage can send a victim into a fit of vertigo with a single touch. The Banisher must touch her target to use this spell (at Life 4, she can cast Induce Vertigo at sensory range). Subtract the target's Stamina from the spell roll. The spell affects the target's inner ear, causing him to become dizzy, nauseated, and disoriented. The target's player must make a Stamina + Resolve roll each turn that this spell affects him. Failure means that the target falls down and cannot rise or take any action until the player makes the roll successfully. During that time, the Banisher (or anyone else, for that matter) can perform a killing blow to the target. Even if the player succeeds on the Stamina + Resolve roll, the character suffers a -3 penalty to all actions while the spell is in effect. A mage with Life 2 can cast a covert Ruling spell to cancel this effect (Life 3 to affect others). Normally, this spell is transitory in Duration, though the Banisher can use Duration Factors to extend it. At Life 5, the spell can be cast with a prolonged Duration.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Venom Of The Righteous","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Strength","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","RoteDicePool_Resisted":"Stamina","roteDescription":"Aaron Murphy, the \"Huntsman\" Banisher, developed this rote in his ongoing campaign to kill non-Thyrsus mages. As a Master of Life, he is capable of spreading his \"venom\" over a small area, and then walking through it, delivering killing blows at will. His disciples, however, have to start with the less potent version."}]}
