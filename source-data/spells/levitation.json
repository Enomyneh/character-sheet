At this level of Forces, travel is slow and requires concentration. Success allows the mage to levitate and travel in any direction with a maximum Speed equal to her Gnosis +1 per success (she cannot double this as she could by running on the ground). She must maintain concentration as an instant action (no further rolls are required). She is not very maneuverable, however. She cannot make quick movements to dodge obstacles and does not gain her Defense against any attacks that can reach her. If she is attacked or startled, a reflexive Resolve + Composure roll must be made to maintain concentration. If it fails, she falls, although she can resume concentration as an instant action anytime within a number of turns equal to her Forces dots, halting her plummet instantly, assuming she doesn't hit ground before the. She'd have to fall from an extreme height -- such as from skydiving -- to allow her any time to regain concentration. (Note: This is an exception to the normal rules for losing concentration with a spell). This spell instantly invokes Disbelief in Sleeper witnesses, which immediately works to unravel the magic.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Air Walk","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"Guardian mages find this a very useful spell when they need to perform home or office intrusions to fetch or destroy incriminating evidence -- or to spy on someone from where he least expects it, above."}]}
