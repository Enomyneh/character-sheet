Any container that can hold liquid safely can be used for this spell. Success on the casting simultaneously enchants the container so that the soul or spirit (or alien \"bug\") cannot escape. The lid is usually sealed with wax or with a metal locking mechanism. The jar protects the contents from attacks and is almost indestructible. If the lid is opened, the soul or spirit can flee to its body.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Alien In A Box","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"The Translators have worked out a system whereby certain metals that correspond to certain sectors of the universe or planetary systems must be used in the construction of the container depending on the type of alien the mages wish to contain. If forced to use a standard jar or bottle made of a different substance, the Translator suffers a -1 die penalty. Renewed casting of the spell can extend the duration."}]}
