The mage's Willpower is enhanced as the slightest traces of doubt are swept away. For the duration of the scene, the mage gains extra effect from Willpower expenditures. Each point gives five extra dice instead of three on a dice pool, or raises a Resistance Trait by three instead of two. Furthermore, all Morality (or Wisdom) checks are deferred until the end of the spell. The spell can affect a number of Willpower expenditures equal to the successes made on the casting roll. Any potential enhancements of Willpower that remain when the spell's duration ends are lost. At this level of proficiency, the spell can only target the caster. At Mind 3, it can affect others. The benefits of this spell do not stack with the similar quality inherent to Hollow Ones.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"Certainty Of Purpose","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation or Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","roteDescription":"The Seers of the Throne are well known as devoted 0followers of their cause, but even the most devoted suffer from doubt.
