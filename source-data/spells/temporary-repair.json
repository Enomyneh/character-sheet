So this spell won't make a machine run without fuel or energy or make a computer with corrupted software functional, for example, but will do things such as make a car with punctured tires or missing a sparkplug run or restore a jammed gun to working order. When the Duration expires, the machine returns to its former state, although the spell itself doesn't cause any additional damage apart from normal wear and tear.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Engineer's Kick","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"With a swift kick or thump and an exclamation like \"Work!,\" the caster can bring otherwise dead machines roaring back to life.
