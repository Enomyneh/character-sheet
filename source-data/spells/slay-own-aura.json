This destruction permanently removes all signature of the mage's current aura, such that it cannot be read by any magic. The mage develops a new aura by the end of the week as his soul takes on new resonance based on his actions and character. This new aura cannot be recognized by anyone who has not examined it before, giving the mage a new mystical \"fingerprint.\" In the meantime, mages who use aura-perception spells to view the mage are unnerved by the target's complete lack of an aura -- an unnatural occurrence.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Starting Anew","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"The Free Council is in many ways all about a fresh start, and this rote proves that Death is merely the gateway to a new beginning.
