As with the Divination spell, the mage can ask one question about a target or event per success. Instead of reading the future, however, he reads how things might be, provided some action or event comes to pass. Note that a target's dots in the Destiny Merit (if any) levy penalties on the spellcasting roll -- it is more difficult to find an alternate future when a person's fate is ordained. Because of the vagueness of prophetic ability at this level, the mage learns only broad and sweeping details. The same target can be targeted with this spell only once every 24 hours.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Merlin's Foresight","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Protecting the Mysteries is not always simply a matter of knowing the past or perceiving the present. Sometimes such work involves discerning that which has not yet come. In this fashion, the ignorant can be shepherded away from perils they lack the discernment to understand, and the occult world can be shielded from the gaze of those who might seek to do it harm in their blindness."}]}
