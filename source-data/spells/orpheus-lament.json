{"name":"Orpheus' Lament","sourceBook":"Grimoire of Grimoires","sourcePage":"131","primaryArcana":"Death","arcanaRequirement":"Death 3","requirements":[{"name":"Death","dots":"3"}],"practice":"Perfecting","action":"Instant and contested; target rolls Composure + Gnosis reflexively","duration":"Concentration","aspect":"Covert","cost":"None","effect":"Casting this rote as described in the Orpheus' Last Riddle grimoire requires that the mage sings or plays an appropriately depressing song. A mage who improvises this spell doesn't have to provide a musical component, but the player suffers a -1 to the casting roll. The song engulfs any sentient being within earshot with a feeling of depression and hopelessness. Any listener whose player fails to exceed the mage's casting successes on a Composure + Gnosis roll suffers a penalty to all deliberate actions equal to the mage's successes. A \"deliberate\" action is one into which the character must put conscious effort. Attacking an enemy, searching for an exit, and driving a car are all deliberate actions, but a reflexive roll to resist another power is not. Perception rolls are not necessarily deliberate, but noticing one's surroundings does require a degree of involvement with them, and so such rolls receive a negative modifier equal to the mage's Expression rating. Obviously, characters who cannot hear are exempt from the effects of this spell. Also, the caster has no ability to choose targets -- it affects everyone within earshot. He can warn any allies in the area, of course, enabling them to prepare themselves (casting a Mental Shield, using earplugs, spending Willpower on the resistance roll), but beyond that, the song saddens everyone who hears it. The effect lasts as long as the mage keeps singing.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Orpheus' Last Riddle Rote","roteName":"Orpheus' Lament","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Just as the spell, above."}]}
