This spell is much the same as Psychic Projection, save that the willworker enters the dreams of a sleeping individual. The mage can use Mind spells while within those dreams to alter the subject's \"psychic landscape,\" controlling the complexion of dreams with as much or as little precision as she wishes. If the mage wishes, she may link her dreams to those of others (by adding extra Target factors to the casting), enabling all to share a common dream.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Morpheus' Road","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Composure + Gnosis","roteDescription":"Mages of the Mysterium use this rote to delve into the secrets of the inner universe, seeking answers within the thoughts and dreams of others. Such a willworker could seek the source of a psychosis, help an individual to combat her nightmares, or even just use one person's dreams as a convenient meeting place for a cabal. Guardians of the Veil are also known to use this rote, carefully sculpting the dreams of those who grow too close to the Mysteries and encouraging them to seek their answers upon false trails, or to abandon such quests entirely."}]}
