Bashing damage is converted to lethal. Attacks that already inflict lethal damage are unaffected. The spell affects one future attack roll per success. The player can choose which of his attack rolls are affected, but he must choose before he rolls the dice for each attack. This effect lasts for one scene (unless additional Duration factors are added during casting), after which time any unused Kinetic Blows are lost. With Forces 3, the mage can use this spell with ranged-weapon attacks such as thrown rocks.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Knife Fist","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Strength","roteDicePool_Skill":"Brawl or Weaponry","roteDescription":"The greatest martial artists can kill with a single blow.
