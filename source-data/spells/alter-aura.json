She can create the seeming of any mental or emotional state she wishes (she does not actually alter her emotional state, only its appearance in her aura). She cannot, however, alter her nature to appear to be something she is not (she can't take on the aura of a Sleeper or vampire). See the Aura charts for the Aura Perception spell. If cast conjunctionally with Prime 2, this spell can also alter the nature of the mage's aura as per the Transform Aura spell. This spell cannot be detected except by a Third Eye spell or the Supernal Vision Mage Sight spell with a higher Potency. Even once this spell is detected, the true mental or emotional state of the mage can only be perceived by overcoming this spell's Potency with that of a spell designed to read an aura's mental state, such as Aura Perception, unless the altered aura is dispelled.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Donning The Inner Mask","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"Perhaps most commonly employed by Guardians to disguise their true intent, this rote nevertheless sees use for a wide variety of ends.
