For each success rolled, the mage manages to completely shut down one of his target's senses: Sight, sound, taste, smell, or touch. This can be used to protect someone from certain dangers that take effect through some sort of sensory stimulation, or it can simply ensure that someone is not a witness to whatever the mage plans to do next.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Sacrifice Of The Mind","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"As much as the Guardians of the Veil prefer not to use vulgar magic before witnesses, sometimes the alternatives are worse. A Guardian will use this spell on as many Sleepers as possible before a mighty vulgar spell, or series of effects, he knows is coming and cannot prevent. This is just another way that the Guardians help safeguard the Awakened world from the unwanted attentions of the Sleepers. With the spell's duration, however, the Guardian's timing needs to be impeccable."}]}
