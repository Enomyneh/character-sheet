He can discern the presence of derangements, but not necessarily their kind (that might require a period of study with an extended Intelligence + Empathy roll).

Some soul marks (such as serving as a vampiric vessel) are sufficiently rare and insidious as to penalize rolls made to perceive them.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Wounds Of The Soul","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","roteDescription":"Arrow mages seek to exploit any weakness their enemies might display.
