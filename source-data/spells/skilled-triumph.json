Some of the Awakened, however, discuss a similar realm that is to the nuances of the human body what the Collective Unconscious is to the mind. A mage who uses this spell can tap into that place, where the body-memory of all the greatest physical feats of humanity is kept, allowing even the most strenuous of physical feats to become simple. For each success on the spellcasting roll, the mage gains one use of the rote action ability on any Physical Skill. This may not be used to augment magical uses of the Skill (such as rote activation). At Life 5, the mage may grant this ability to others by touch.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium","roteName":"The Olympian Collective","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Strength","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"To a viewer, it might seem that the mage who invokes this rote is simply stretching, or posing in some mimicry of athletes the world over. In actuality, the Mysterium mage draws upon his knowledge of the thousand-thousand athletes of history, assuming their poses, claiming their victories for himself in body posture and will."}]}
