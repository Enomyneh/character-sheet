(Note: This effect differs from the Counterspell spell, which requires one dot in only one of the Arcana used by the target spell.) The successes of the dispelling mage's effort must exceed the Potency of the existing spell to successfully dispel it.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Prayer To San Cipriano","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","RoteDicePool_Contested":"target spell's Potency","roteDescription":"This rote was created by an Obrimos Catholic priest, who considered Atlantean ideas to be heresy, sometime in the 1800s. He ended up among the Nameless, training a few apprentices in the service of San Cipriano, the patron saint of magic and those who needed protection against witchcraft. Similar to many other cultural expressions of magic that eschew the legend of Atlantis, this prayer ended up among Free Council mages, who value it for its ability to remove magics. The Imago of the spell involves an image of the saint laying hands on the magic, and then taking it with him when he climbs back up the Watchtower to the Aether. Factor Bonuses: Medallion of San Cipriano (+1 factor); Burning a candle dedicated to San Cipriano (+1 factor); Sprinkling target of spell with holy water (+1 factor)."}]}
