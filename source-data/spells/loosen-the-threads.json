It also unsticks swollen doors or windows and allows rusted shut locks to be manipulated normally. Only 1 success is necessary for most locks, knots, stuck doors, or rusted locks. Occasionally the Storyteller may require more than 1 success for particularly difficult or complicated examples of the above. This spell does not confer silence, so any noise inherent in springing a lock or forcing open a door that is swollen shut occurs naturally unless the mage by some means masks or negates the noise. Professional locksmiths or burglars or mages with other appropriate skills may simply state they are taking precautions against unwanted noise. The object will remain unlocked, untied, etc., until it is locked or tied again (or until the door is shut, etc.).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Unbind The Twisted Tress","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Dexterity","roteDicePool_Skill":"Larceny","roteDescription":"In their constant search for lost magic and due to their tendency to come up against odd combinations of materials that do not always respond to magic from a single Arcana, the Mysterium has devised this rote for handling objects that blend together unusual materials, such as living plant matter with monofilament wire, etc.  Note Life may be used for this roll if appropriate."}]}
