She creates a small bubble of \"warped\" time, either speeding herself up or slowing things down as they approach her. She performs small manipulations to her immediate temporal surroundings, protecting herself from harm by delicately twisting the fabric of time. She could, for example, decelerate incoming gunfire (by expanding the fourth-dimensional axis of its movement) or slightly speed up her own motions so as to allow her to roll better with punches and other attacks. The mage gains one point of armor per dot she possesses in the Time Arcanum. By spending one Mana, the Duration can be made to last for one day. Most mages cast such a shielding spell at the beginning of the day, as part of their morning rituals. Successes are used to combat attempts to dispel the shield. Note that this magical armor applies against attempts to grapple the caster (both his Defense and Temporal Dodge armor are subtracted from the grappler's dice pool when he attempts to achieve a hold on the mage), but it does not protect against attempts by an opponent to overpower and/or inflict damage once he has managed to grapple the mage.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Dancing Upon The River","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Dexterity","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"The River of Time is a dangerous place.
