These include sources that are currently present, but have grown less intense, as well as those that have disappeared completely. She can track the progress of the dispersing Resonance over time, as well as any sudden changes that took place during the time period studied (such as magical alterations to a given source of Resonance). She is not able to learn who did these things, or how (not without making use of other magics, at any rate), but can use this magic to get a feel for the local pattern of Resonance. This spell's Potency is used to determine how far back the mage can look, as well as to contest any temporal or Resonance occlusion that might have been used in the mage's immediate vicinity.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
