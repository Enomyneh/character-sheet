He could, for example, make a hurtling truck slow down, or speed up (or slow down) a bullet. Although the casting is an instant action, the mage can cast this spell at any point in the Initiative roster, even before he could normally act, although doing so is his action for the turn. Each success doubles or halves the target object's speed. For example, a truck going 80 mph is reduced to 40 mph with one success, 20 mph with two successes, 10 mph with three successes, 5 mph with four successes, and two-and-a-half mph with five successes. Note that the mage must be able to affect the entire target and its Size (which might be up to 30 or more for an 18-wheeler rig and tow). He can't single out portions of it, such as slowing the velocity of a single tire and so slow the whole truck (while causing the passengers and objects inside to be thrown forward). High-speed projectiles such as arrows and bullets cannot be halted at this level. Instead, add (for increased velocity) or subtract (for decreased velocity) one point of damage per every two successes as shown in the below chart. For turning autofire from the same gun, use the following autofire dice penalties chart.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
