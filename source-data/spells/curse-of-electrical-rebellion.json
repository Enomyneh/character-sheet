Computers, automobiles, elevators, heaters, hair dryers and cell phones comprise just part of the list of rebellious devices. Malfunctions range in seriousness from merely inconvenient to life-threatening. The mage must add five to the target number per point of Mana spent. Whenever the item's owner is in proximity to a functioning electronic device, and there is some chance that its malfunction might harm him, or seriously hamper his pursuit of his current goals, the Storyteller rolls a die pool equal to the Mana spent on this spell during item creation. On a success, the device malfunctions. On an exceptional success, the device's malfunction threatens the owner's life. (Bystanders may suffer collateral damage.) A one-die bonus accrues if the item owner is acting against the interests of the order the creating mage belonged to at the time of the item's enchantment.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Fatal Error","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"Free Council technophiles enjoy bringing down their opponents with items that opportunistically monkeywrench their gear."}]}
