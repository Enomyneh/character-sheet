On the turn following a successful casting, the mage's player can require that every player who has a character affected by the spell's Target factors declare what his character's action will be for that turn. The Storyteller does the same for his characters. The player does not need to declare his own action for the turn, but can wait to act at any point within the initiative order, trumping all other supernatural Initiative effects. (In the event that two or more willworkers use this spell during the same scene, determine their Initiatives normally, in the event that more than one attempts to act at the same time.) In addition, the character gains +1 Defense per spellcasting success against attacks from those affected by the spell. (This is in addition to any benefit provided by the Acceleration spell.)","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Measure The River's Flow","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Composure + Gnosis","roteDescription":"Ultimately, knowledge and understanding can overcome any strength of arms. Mages of the Adamantine Arrow understand this wisdom and use this rote to predict, and thus dictate, the pacing of a violent encounter. Willworkers of the Silver Ladder have sometimes been known to use this magic (Presence + Occult + Time) in order to control less physical (but no less dangerous) situations."}]}
