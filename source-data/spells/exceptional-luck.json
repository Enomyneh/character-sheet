The mage gains the 9-again quality (re-roll results of 9 and 10) on one future dice roll per success. The player can choose which of his rolls are affected by this exceptional luck (declared before dice are rolled), and they can include any action or task. This effect lasts for one scene (unless additional Duration factors are added during casting), after which time any unused luck rolls are lost. Note that this spell does not affect a chance die, should a player's dice pool be reduced to one. Only a result of 10 is a success.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Blessing Of The Gods","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Prowess of arms can take a mage only so far.
