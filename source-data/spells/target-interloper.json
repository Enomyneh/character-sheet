Typically, the spell must be capable of targeting an individual, without a complex set of options. However, if a ghost has been bound to the item, that entity can make any necessary decisions when the defense mechanism activates. When enchanting the item, add three successes to the target number for each of the target spell's dots to allow the spell to target and trigger against interlopers. So, to allow the item to trigger the four-dot spell Trigger the Lizard Brain, 12 successes would be required. Upon successful casting of this spell, the mage then rolls her usual dice pool for an improvised casting of the subject spell. The defensive spell gains one Potency per success. If the subject spell requires Mana, the item must be infused with it, per the usual Imbue Item process, and the item must have Mana to spend when triggered by an interloper. Without sufficient Mana, the effect is not activated.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"The Artful Tripwire","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Silver Ladder mages appreciate the opportunities this spell provides to showcase both one's mystical ingenuity, and one's commitment to property rights."}]}
