This spell has no affect on anyone who is wide awake, frightened, or otherwise not fatigued or sleepy. However, if the mage uses this spell on a sleeping target, unless the target suffers damage or significant pain, she will not awaken for the Duration of this spell. Even loud noises will not awaken her. As long as targets are not injured, they will not awaken if they are shaken, tied up or carried relatively carefully. If this spell is used upon a target who is awake but also exhausted, sleepy, drunk or otherwise in a state in which it is easy to fall asleep, the target gradually falls asleep over the course of around 15 minutes unless some person, loud noise, or similar event prevents the target from doing so. Additional successes reduce the time required for the target to fall asleep. Once the target is asleep, this spell also keeps her asleep; otherwise, the sleep induced by this spell is perfectly normal sleep, and once the Duration expires, the target can be awakened normally.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium","roteName":"Hypnos's Subtle Grasp","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","roteDescription":"The simplest way to deal with anyone who might object to the presence of an intruder is to either cause the person to fall asleep or keep an already sleeping person asleep. No one is surprised if a guard falls asleep at her post or if a wealthy person sleeps through his house being robbed."}]}
