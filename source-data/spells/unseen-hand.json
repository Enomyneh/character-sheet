A simple success lifts the target into the air. The spell's Strength is equal to its successes. The mage can move the living creature at a Speed per turn equal to his Gnosis plus any successes allocated for this purpose. The target cannot be moved beyond the mage's sight (unless he uses Space 2 to scry it). Each turn, the victim can attempt to struggle free from the telekinetic grip. It takes an instant action and a Strength + Athletics or Brawl roll, penalized by the spell's assigned Strength. With Forces 5, this spell can have a default Duration of prolonged (one scene), in which case when the caster is not actively manipulating the target, the target stays where the caster left him, even if he levitates in the air (although the target can try to break the hold as described above).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Unyielding Grasp","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Brawl","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Composure + Gnosis","roteDescription":"The Adamantine Arrow often uses this rote to freeze enemies in place, or to lift them high and then drop them.
