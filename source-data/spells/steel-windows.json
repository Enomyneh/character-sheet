He could, for example, make the outer surface of a bank vault door transparent, allowing him to see the mechanisms within. At this level, the mage must touch the targeted object (although he can do so using forceps or other tools). With Matter 3, he can cast this spell at sensory range.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Gaze Through The Mountain","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts or Occult","roteDescription":"Sometimes, a Guardian is an investigator, sometimes an assassin, and sometimes she must be a spy. This rote enables a mage to literally see through walls that occlude her activities. While the transparency or opacity of the affected material goes both ways, a clever willworker can find ways to use such magic to her advantage."}]}
