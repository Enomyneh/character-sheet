To all intents and purposes, the targeted individual appears catatonic or, at best, profoundly autistic. Attempts to communicate by other means, such as drawing or writing (including typing), result in gibberish. The mage must succeed in a contested role to exercise this power over an Awakened target, and an Awakened victim may attempt a contested role against the original success to break out of the loop. If the casting mage wishes, she may attempt to reinforce the strength of the loop by re-casting the spell each month. Casting the spell sooner results in failure or, in the event of a dramatic failure, the breaking of the loop. Sleepers have no defense against this rote unless another mage has imbued them with protections against Mind magic.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Welcome To Roger's World","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Roger's peculiar take on this spell, and the form the spell takes whenever he casts it, causes the victim to speak in inarticulate phrases, unable to finish any thoughts either mentally or verbally. This means that a victim of \"Roger's World\" cannot even put together the complete thought \"I'm going to try to overcome this spell\" without first succeeding in a Willpower roll against a difficulty of 10."}]}
