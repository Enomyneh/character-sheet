Each success creates one degree of sympathetic connection between the target and a single person, place, or thing, as per the sympathetic spells chart. For example, a mage who barely knows a woman he just met (an Encountered connection) can be given a greater degree of sympathetic connection to her (with three successes, this can be come an Intimate connection). This does not change the normal mental and social relationship between the two, only their mystical connection that can be exploited through Space magic. A living creature unconsciously resists this spell with its Composure.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Spinning The False Strand","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","RoteDicePool_Resisted":"Composure","roteDescription":"Sometimes the only way to get close to someone is to create the means oneself. Free Council mages use this rote to forge an artificial sympathetic connection with another person, usually for the purposes of targeting that individual remotely with other magics. Guardians use a rote much like it (Composure + Occult + Space) to affect others at great distance, without ever needing to reveal themselves."}]}
