From that point onwards, the victim loses one dot in a Physical Attribute every time a predetermined interval passes. The shorter the interval, the greater the target number needed for casting. Dots are lost from the victim's highest Attribute first. When two or more Attributes have the same current value, the Storyteller randomly chooses between them. This Attribute damage is permanent until the item is destroyed or disenchanted, or is willingly acquired by a new owner. This gives knowing victims strong incentives to pass the curse along.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
