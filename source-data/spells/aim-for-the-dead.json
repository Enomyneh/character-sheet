This spell is a variant of the spell Sharpshooter's Eye. The mage uses Death 1 to lock on to a vampire, reanimated corpse, or other undead creature. Each success removes one die of penalties to strike a specific target on its body. If the mage is using a ranged weapon, the spell also reduces all ranged combat penalties except for cover, armor, and magical protection. The benefit applies to the mage's next attack. Knowledgeable mages use the spell in conjunction with a wooden stake to target a vampire's heart. Other walking corpses might be stopped in their tracks with a bullet to the brainpan or a blow that mars the mystic Brand that brought the corpse to life. If the mage knows the second rank in each of the spell's component Arcana, he can bestow this ability upon another person.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Stake Strikes True","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Weaponry","roteDescription":"A former Adamantine Arrow called Lacon took this rote from the Adamantine Arrow and spread it far and wide among American Banishers. The rote is based on the Arrow's close-range spear-fighting techniques, combined with a rigorous study of anatomy and the strange energies that animate the cursed dead. This rote is more limited than the basic version of the spell, as the weapon-based Imago does not lend the rote's benefits to ranged attacks."}]}
