Mages are able to cast covert spells by working within the established rules for what is considered possible in the Fallen World. This spell forces magic used by the mage to manifest itself visibly and audibly. An Alter Integrity spell used to weaken a lock might cause the lock to shriek with the sound of bending metal and glow red (for example). With a successful casting, every spell cast by the targeted mage is considered vulgar for the remainder of the scene. Additionally, every casting uncloaks the cursed mage's nimbus in an enhanced state, making the nimbus stronger in effect than is usual. The summation of all this excess magical energy results in the addition of +1 die to each Paradox check made by the cursed mage during the scene.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Force Paradox","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Order mages who have studied literature of more organized and educated Banishers have found citations of Paradox as support for their theories that magic is unnatural. They insist that if mages were meant to wield mystical powers, counterforces such as Paradox wouldn't exist. Banishers claim this rote was first developed in Atlantis by the Timori, but such claims are dubious at best, and near impossible to prove."}]}
