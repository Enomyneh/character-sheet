{"name":"Swarm Of Locusts","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"161","primaryArcana":"Fate","arcanaRequirement":"Fate 5","requirements":[{"name":"Fate","dots":"5"}],"practice":"Patterning","action":"Instant","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Vulgar","cost":"None","effect":"The mage can create chaotic conditions: Rains of frogs, every animal within a city block going berserk simultaneously, and other similarly \"Fortean\" occurrences. He totally surrenders control of the effects of the spell when he casts it; he puts the matter in Fate's hands. While Sleepers who witness this chaos might be befuddled, confused, and scared, they are temporarily open to the possibilities of magic and are not instrumental in causing Paradoxes for any spell they witness in the affected area. Those Sleepers who witness the effects of the Swarm of Locusts do not act as witnesses when determining the chances of a Paradox for any successive spell cast in the area (although the Swarm of Locusts spell must still contend with a possible Paradox, the chances of which are made worse by Sleeper witnesses). The space covered by Swarm of Locusts depends on the successes rolled. The chaos seething in the area is beyond the caster's control and might adversely affect him or his allies. Depending on the description of the effect, the Storyteller might levy a -1 to -2 dice penalty on any rolls made that are not directly involved in dealing with the chaos. This spell cannot be cast a second time within the same area (or in adjacent areas) for the next 24 hours.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
