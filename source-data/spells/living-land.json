Instead of targeting a specific object, the mage affects an area. Within that, he may designate allies, neutrals, and enemies. Inside the area of effect, each ally adds bonus dice equal to the spell's Potency to 1 roll of the caster's choosing. Each enemy suffers a dice penalty to 1 roll equal to the spell's Potency. Neutrals experience no specialconditions. Debris, local wildlife, wind, light, and other ambient environmental effects benefit the mage's friends and harass enemies. The mage determines when and how each person experiences the effects of the spell. He can also spend extra levels of Potency to modify an additional roll for 1 set of allies or 1 set of enemies within the spell's area of effect and duration.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Ryutora No Jutsu","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","roteDescription":"Ryutora means \"Tiger and Dragon,\" or colloquially, \"two powerful rivals.\" The Gogyo also calls the rote by this name to evoke the principles of feng shui. The mage uses ritualized threats and orders to array half-slumbering spirits in service to his cause. Trees, stones, clouds, insects -- all of them hinder foes and help allies."}]}
