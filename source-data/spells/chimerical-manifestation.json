The mage must focus on a particular object in Astral Space; his sympathetic connection to the object modifies the casting roll. (Consider any object the mage has encountered in his own Oneiros -- including objects brought from other realms of Astral Space -- to be intimately connected to him.) When the object manifests, it appears identical to the astral object in every way. If the object qualifies as an imbued item or an Artifact, the mage must also have Prime 4 and supply Mana for the object's Mana pool. However, the mage does not need to be capable of casting any spells the item may contain.<BR>","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
