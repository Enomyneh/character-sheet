He can also detect their unseen presence if they are hiding or have chosen to not reveal themselves. Unless the mage has some means of peering across the Gauntlet or affecting the Shadow World, he can converse only with Twilight spirits. (The mage can speak across the barrier of the Gauntlet with the Spirit 2 Peer Across the Gauntlet spell.) The mage can see ghosts, too, but they appear hazy and indistinct and he cannot hear them unless he also uses Death 1 while casting this spell. He cannot perceive mental projections in Twilight unless he adds Mind 1 to the casting. This spell's successes must exceed the Potency of any power (if any) used to conceal the spirit.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Fleshless Speech","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Socialize","roteDescription":"Mages of the Mysterium have many reasons for dealing with the denizens of Twilight (or the Shadow Realm). Some spirits recall the crafting (or final resting places) of ancient relics, and might be willing to share such knowledge for a price. Conversely, some spirits pay close attention to the happenings of the world of flesh and can prove invaluable informants. This rote enables a member of the Mysterium to communicate with a spirit currently inhabiting the same plane of existence as her (though it by no means guarantees civil or any discourse on the part of the spirit). Silver Ladder willworkers use the same rote in their own dealings with entities of the unseen world."}]}
