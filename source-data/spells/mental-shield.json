He can defend his thoughts, shielding them against the notice of others. This may mean concealing his mind from any kind of detection, blatantly preventing others from reading any of his thoughts or just concealing particular thoughts. The mage subtracts one die per dot he possesses in the Mind Arcanum from spells or supernatural powers that attempt to mentally control, detect, or influence him. By spending one Mana, the Duration can be made to last for one day. Most mages cast such a shielding spell at the beginning of the day, as part of their morning rituals. Successes are used to combat attempts to dispel the shield. In addition, the Mental Shield helps its caster see through mental illusions such as the Misperception spell or Imposter spell. Upon first encountering such a spell, the user can see through the illusion with reflexive and contested Gnosis + Mind roll. This spell can be cast at any point in a turn, even if the caster's Initiative would have him act later than an attacker. In this way, it is similar to a dodge action.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Steel Trap","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Adamantine Arrow mages like the psychic bulwark such magic provides.
