{"name":"Geas","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"160","primaryArcana":"Fate","arcanaRequirement":"Fate 5","requirements":[{"name":"Fate","dots":"5"}],"practice":"Making","action":"Instant and contested; target rolls Resolve + Gnosis reflexively","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Vulgar","cost":"None","effect":"This spell creates a geas, enabling a willworker to forcibly compel another to heed her will as though having sworn an oath to that effect. If the subject cannot resist this magic, then he must do as he is bidden or suffer the enmity of destiny. The mage is under no obligation to be reasonable when levying a Geas upon another, although the objective must still be possible. \"Count every grain of sand on this beach,\" while extraordinarily improbable for most people, is at least possible, but \"Using only your own physical abilities, swim to the bottom of the ocean and back,\" is not. Note that, unlike the powers of the Mind Arcanum, this spell does not compel a target to perform a task. It instead sets up terrible repercussions if he doesn't perform it. Those who violate the terms of a Geas (failing to actively work toward fulfilling the Geas counts as violating it) during the spell's Duration suffer the effects of the Great Curse spell, below, until such time as the Geas would normally expire. Geas has the potential for greater longevity than most prolonged five-dot spells. When increasing Duration factors during casting, the mage uses the advanced prolongation factors chart, even if he does not have six dots in Fate.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
