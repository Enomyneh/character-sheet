He could issue a suicidal command and compel another to heed it or force her to do something she considers absolutely abhorrent. This is exactly the same as manipulating a mind or telepathically controlling it, save that there is literally no limit to the sorts of thoughts and behaviors the willworker can force upon a subject.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Your Will Is Mine","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Resolve + Gnosis","roteDescription":"The ultimate act of mental influence, this rote enables a Silver Ladder willworker to force compliance in another. Mages of the Mysterium by and large find such magic distasteful, but they also recognize its occasional necessity, so have a variant of their own (Wits + Intimidation + Mind)."}]}
