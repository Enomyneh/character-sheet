Upon successfully casting this spell, the mage draws a reflection of her Vice out of herself and incarnates it into the same sort of stabilized ephemera that comprises familiars. This spell uses the advanced prolongation Duration factors. The mage must spend experience to cement the bond with this familiar, as normal, though the costs for doing so are slightly different. (See the Goetic Familiar Merit) The Willpower dot spent in the casting of this spell may be bought back at the cost of 8 Experience Points.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Non-Order-Specific Rote","roteName":"The Face Of Sin","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Some cultures believed in the notion of an invisible and otherworldly devil at one's ear, whispering dark counsel. Those who make use of this magic have the opportunity to be somewhat more directly guided toward wickedness by the devil within. For the price of such sinful inspiration, however, they enjoy the assistance of their inner demons in ways more meaningful than an occasional shred of advice that runs counter to conscience."}]}
