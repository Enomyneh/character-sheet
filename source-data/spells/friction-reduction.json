A book on a table will appear to slide effortlessly across the surface with little resistance. A walker will have a hard time maintaining a foothold. Objects on an incline will move downward. The mage reduces the friction in a given area according to her successes. Any person walking on that area suffers a -1 penalty to any action that might have required normal friction to be present, whether it's a Drive roll to keep control of a car or an Athletics roll to walk across the frictionless surface (other rolls may apply per situation). This penalty can be increased by raising the spell's Potency factors during casting. Characters who fall into objects take damage accordingly.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
