Though the spell makes such a journey possible, the spell does not make the journey easy. Astral travelers must find the path or portal between Oneiroi in order to move from one to the other, and dream spaces sometimes portray the portals idiosyncratically. Standard use of this spell connects the caster's Oneiros to the target's, but the caster may instead connect the Oneiroi of two others. Unwilling targets contest the spell with Resolve + Gnosis. When cast in Astral Space, this spell relies on real-world sympathy.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
