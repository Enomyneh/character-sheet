This spell braids the fates of two subjects together, such that the fate of one becomes the fate of the other. Whatever befalls one subject affects the other and vice versa. In times past, this spell was used as a means of parley between willworkers, to ensure both parties honored a truce. This spell still sees some use in that regard, but is more a means of threatening an enemy and ensuring their cooperation. The spell links two subjects (more with an additional Targets factor). Unwilling subjects get a reflexive Composure + Gnosis roll to resist. If the spell succeeds, the subjects are bound to a single fate for its duration. Effects affecting the Health or Willpower (but not Wisdom) of one subject affect the other by an equal amount. So, if one of the subjects suffers three levels of Health damage, the other subject does as well. Any Fate magic worked on one subject -- for good or ill -- also affects the other(s).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Instant Karma","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","roteDescription":"\"My fate will be yours,\" was a commonly heard oath from the Nameless, and they usually made good on it with this techn&eacute;.
