By touching a machine and successfully casting this spell, the mage immediately learns the machine's password or passcode, if it has one. If the machine has multiple codes, the mage learns the one for the machine's currently active function. For example, if Invoke Password is cast while touching a computer, the mage learns the passcode to the currently open program window or function. If the spell is cast on an active alarm panel, the mage learns the code to disarm it, and so forth. If there are two or more equally viable functions with passcodes, the mage learns one of them at random, along with what it accesses. The caster must still have some means of inputting the code acquired with this spell. If the machine requires an input device (such as a key card or transmitter) that the mage doesn't have, then the code itself doesn't do much good. The spell also doesn't provide passcodes that can't be entered by human hands; if the machine's only passcode is entered via encoded keycard, for example, then the spell tells the mage nothing.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Cracker's Code","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"Sometimes magic makes a more effective supplement to mundane skills; an Awakened hacker with a willingness to \"cheat\" can be a terror, as others discovered when the Free Council adopted the digital revolution as part of their own. The Atlantean orders have since learned to ward their computer systems, but Sleepers remain as blissfully unaware as ever."}]}
