The Underworld is a dread place where, according to most mages, ghosts without anchors are banished. The caster can use other spells to compel the ghost to manifest, or can provide ectoplasm for its manifestation. This spell is most often cast to learn the secrets of the long-departed, such as the locations of lost treasures or the existence of lost heirs. The mage can ask one question of the ghost per success. After it has answered it departs, returning to the Underworld. (The mage cannot delay for more than five turns between questions, or else the ghost departs.) The entity's answers are truthful and straightforward, although if a question is not clear and concise, the ghost might misinterpret it and give a misleading answer.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Demanding An Audience Of The Departed","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Resistance","roteDescription":"Even the denizens of the Underworld are not forbidden to one who attains mastery of the Arcanum of Death.

Mages of the Mysterium (Manipulation + Persuasion + Death) most commonly cast one much like it with the intention of learning more esoteric lore."}]}
