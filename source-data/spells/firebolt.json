Each success assigned to the Potency of this spell inflicts one Health box of lethal damage to the target, who is allowed to apply her Defense against the attack. With Forces 5, the caster can spend a point of Mana to make this spell inflict aggravated damage. Note that flammable objects in the target's vicinity are apt to be set ablaze by this attack.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Sword Of Michael","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Dexterity","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"While some Arrows prefer lightning and others sonic bursts, the simple fact of the matter is that more supernatural weirdness appears to be harmed in a meaningful way by fire than by any other natural form of energy.
