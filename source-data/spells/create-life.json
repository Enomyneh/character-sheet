Granted, without the uses of other Arcana like Mind, this construct is mindless, motivated only by instinct, but few can argue with the sheer, godlike authority possessed by one who is able to conjure up life at will. The target number of successes is determined by the creature's Size (on a one-for-one basis) and Physical Attributes (also on a one-for-one basis).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"New Beginnings","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Animal Ken","roteDescription":"Guardians of the Veil have a number of different reasons for casting this rote. A mindless human body can be created, bribing a troublesome spirit with a host, or a Siberian tiger could be spun out of nothing, giving the mage a body to control with other Life Arcanum spells. Some Free Council mages use this rote to conjure up a desired sample of flora or fauna so as to have a life form on which to pattern transposed characteristics for the Transform Self spell."}]}
