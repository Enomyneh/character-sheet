The spirit must be manifested in the material realm or exist within Twilight (in which case the mage must be able to see it, using a spell such as Gossamer Touch). The caster must have Spirit 4 to heal a spirit across the Gauntlet (and his spellcasting dice pool is penalized by the Gauntlet's Strength). One Corpus point of damage is restored per success.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Spirit Mending","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Empathy","roteDescription":"Free Council willworkers use this rote to repair damage done to the insubstantial flesh of spirits. Such magic can be a powerful bargaining tool in dealing with such entities, though not all use it for such purely mercenary purposes. After all, this magic can also repair harm done to an immaterial familiar. The Mysterium variant of the rote (Resolve + Empathy + Spirit) uses different methods to obtain the same effect."}]}
