This spell creates such a receptacle. Any receptacle that can be used to seal liquid can serve as a soul jar, whether it's a wine bottle, a preserve jar, or even Tupperware. Success on the spellcasting enchants the receptacle so that a soul placed within the jar cannot escape. The jar's lid is usually held fast by a metal bar or is coated with wax. The soul is protected from attack by the object. If the jar is opened or broken, the soul can flee.With Death 3, the mage can attempt to cast this spell with indefinite Duration.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Urn Of Motes","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"In ancient times, Silver Ladder mages would carry out a terrible punishment levied against mage criminals: The severing of their souls.
