This spell alters the mage's features, while also influencing the emotions of everyone who sees the mage so they find him to be more attractive. The effects of this spell are sufficiently subtle that the mage remains easily recognizable. Others simply see him as more attractive than before and are likely to attribute the improved appearance to some change in clothing or grooming on the part of the mage or perhaps never having looked at him closely before. Each success on this roll provides the mage with a +1 modifier to all Presence and Manipulation rolls when he attempts to use his looks to entertain, persuade, distract or deceive others. The bonuses gained from this spell are compatible with those from the Striking Looks Merit.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Impeccable Bearing","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Attractive people are usually quite successful.
