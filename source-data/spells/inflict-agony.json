{"name":"Inflict Agony","sourceBook":"Seers Of The Throne","sourcePage":"191","primaryArcana":"Life","arcanaRequirement":"Life 3","requirements":[{"name":"Life","dots":"3"}],"practice":"Fraying","action":"Extended and contested; target rolls Stamina + Gnosis reflexively","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Covert","cost":"None","effect":"Pain is a powerful motivator. Animals instinctively shrink back from causes of suffering; some scientists even believe that plants do so. Every living thing reflexively does what it can to avoid pain. Thus, some mages find benefit in magic intended to inflict harm upon others without having to resort to more lasting forms of violence, whether as a tool of interrogation or one of simple cruelty. Successes accrued in the casting of this spell (as well as successes accrued to resist) are treated precisely like successes gained in the interrogation process. At the Storyteller's discretion, Inflict Agony may be used to supplement other applications of the Intimidation Skill. Also, a Storyteller may choose to allow a character with the Iron Stamina Merit to add her dots in that Merit as an equipment bonus to her roll to contest this spell. At Life 3, this spell requires touch. With Life 4, it may be cast at sensory range and, at Life 5, it may be cast sympathetically. The use of this spell on an unwilling subject requires a check to resist degeneration when cast by any character with a Wisdom of 4 or greater (roll three dice).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"The General's Burning Gauntlet","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Strength","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","roteDescription":"Seers of the Praetorian Ministry are often confronted with stubborn enemies, unwilling to reveal what they know when offered gentler forms of persuasion.
