Used cautiously, this spell has the potential to cause an enemy mage to be the source of his own undoing. The Guardians of the Veil greatly disapprove of this application of magic, and upon hearing of the use of it, are likely to go to great lengths to dissuade an encore performance. This spell affects the mind of a target Sleeper within sensory range. Any roll for Paradox in the presence of the targeted Sleeper gains the 9-again quality (re-roll results of 9 and 10). In addition, any covert spell the Storyteller rules improbable is considered vulgar. The Storyteller may call for a degeneration roll for overuse of this spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Pride Goeth","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"When forced to battle another mage in front of Sleeper witnesses, the Adepts of Mind among the Arrows combine this spell with their more mundane combat skills. If a mage is foolish or desperate enough to cast vulgar spells during the battle, the Arrow can watch with satisfaction as the backlash from that mage's spells turn the fight against him."}]}
