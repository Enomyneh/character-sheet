This spell provides useful information to the caster who intends to affect a subject through someone or something to whom or to which the target is emotionally bound. It might be a very dear friend, a treasured childhood possession, or that nook beneath the old oak where the subject fell in love for the first time. This sense is sometimes modified by the strength of the bond (the Storyteller might award a bonus for a strong bond, or levy a penalty for a weak one). If the sympathetic bond has been concealed (see the Conceal Sympathy spell) this spell's successes must exceed the disguise spell's Potency.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Revelation Of The Unseen Thread","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Protecting the Mysteries sometimes involves a great deal of detective work. This rote enables a Guardian to track leads through the esoteric connections that bind them. Perhaps a troublesome Sleeper grows too close to the secrets of the occult, because he seeks a cure for his daughter's terminal ailment, or an Artifact exerts a sympathetic pull on him. This sense allows a mage to discern such influences and gives him the opportunity to adjust his tactics accordingly."}]}
