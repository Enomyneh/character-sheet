This spell allows the mage to understand a subject's Final Name, record it in Mana and scribe it in some sort of physical medium -- paper, stone, or even a computer file. Once stored, the Final Name no longer decays and may be studied freely with the Study Final Name spell. This spell's Duration is prolonged if cast on a living being or lasting if cast on the dead. If the caster has Fate 3, the Advanced Prolongation chart may be used to determine the Duration when cast on a living target (remember, though, that spells cast on living beings cannot have an indefinite Duration). If, however, the owner of a recorded Momentary Name dies before the spell's duration expires, the spell's duration becomes lasting: The Momentary Name becomes the Final Name.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Epitaph","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Stone Scribes take their charge very seriously, and never scribe a Final Name on anything less sturdy than stone tablets."}]}
