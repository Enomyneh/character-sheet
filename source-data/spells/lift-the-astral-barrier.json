This spell pays that cost on another's behalf. Once the spell is cast, the target may pass the Astral Threshold without spending any Mana; the Mana spent on this spell replaces that need. The spell's target must still take the journey into the astral through personal meditation, and must reach the Threshold before the spell's Duration ends. If cast with additional Target factors, the spell costs one Mana per target. Astral Space does not trigger Disbelief in Sleepers, though seeing magic there still does.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Freeing The Mind","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Empathy","roteDescription":"In the hope of Awakening mortals or discovering new magic in the Sleeping mind, the Free Council uses this rote to bring Sleepers on astral journeys."}]}
