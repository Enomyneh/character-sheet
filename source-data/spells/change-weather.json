{"name":"Change Weather","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"172","primaryArcana":"Forces","arcanaRequirement":"Forces 4","requirements":[{"name":"Forces","dots":"4"}],"practice":"Patterning","action":"Instant","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Covert","cost":"None","effect":"The mage alters weather patterns, bringing almost any sort of normal (non-disastrous) weather to bear on an area, given enough time and effort. (Note that a frost in late spring, while potentially very destructive to local food production, is not the same sort of thing as a tornado or typhoon, and can be created using this level of Forces.) The inertia of current weather patterns might levy dice penalties. Making threatening thunderclouds release a downpour might cause no penalty, while turning a bright summer's day into freezing rain might cause a -3 dice penalty. It takes about five minutes after casting for the storm effects to develop. Major conditions, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, require the Adverse Weather spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Rainmaker","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult or Science","roteDescription":"Long has humanity tried to harness weather to its own ends. A Free Council mage with this rote can call up rain to end a drought, a bit of warmth to break a cold snap, or whatever other non-extreme condition she desires. Mysterium mages use alternate means to control these forces (Resolve + Science + Forces), but accomplish the same ends."}]}
