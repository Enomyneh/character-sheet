The mage retains full control of her reason in this form, as do any she chooses to change (unless she would rather have another be forced to fight for control of his faculties, as per the lesser Shapechanging spell at Life 4). The mage must deal with the same modifiers for Size as he does with the lesser Shapechanging spell. He may also cast the Life 3 Transform Self spell to add different features to the changed form, but he is not restricted to lesser life forms.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Hour Of The Wolf","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Animal Ken","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Stamina + Gnosis","roteDescription":"Without the threat of losing herself in the form she adopts, this rote can be one of the strongest weapons in an Arrow's arsenal, especially considering her ability to freely modify her new shape. Such a willworker can become a veritable living siege engine, combining all of the deadliest characteristics in the plant and animal kingdoms, as she wills. Mysterium mages are also known to use a version of this rote for their own purposes."}]}
