Note that a mage trying to get another to alter the tenets of an oath can easily constitute intent to violate said vow (and therefore subject the mage to the deleterious effects of breaking an oath). The targeted oath's Potency acts as dice penalties to the casting roll. (If this spell is cast as an extended action instead of an instant action, the target oath's Potency provides the target number needed.) Once an oath is so altered, it remains altered for the remainder of its Duration. A mage cannot alter an oath she has made for herself (as under Fate 2) until she has Fate 4.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Nullify The Contract","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Politics","roteDescription":"There are times when it simply isn't expedient to be bound by the letter of the law. When the law is a Fate-enforced oath, mages of the Silver Ladder can either endure the consequences of their promises or make use of this rote. Of course, willworkers of the Free Council also enjoy the freedom offered by this magic (Wits + Politics + Fate), and are known to alter the \"small details\" of binding vows their cabal-mates make."}]}
