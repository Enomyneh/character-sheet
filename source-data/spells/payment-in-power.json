Instead of sacrificing a Willpower dot, the willworker pays Mana, spent over a period of days. Mana spent for this purpose is in addition to any other Mana costs required to make the Enhanced Item. The high Mana cost of this spell is exacted over a period of days. The mage spends 1 Mana at the time of casting. Twenty-four hours later, the willworker loses another point of Mana. The process repeats itself for 20 days, until 20 points of Mana have been spent. Mana losses occur whether the mage likes it or not. If at the end of any interval the willworker has no Mana left, all spells woven into the item (including those cast by collaborators) are dispelled. Worse, Mana continues to drain from the mage at a rate of one per day until 20 points have been harvested, even to the point of scourging the mage against his will to get them.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Conservation Of The Will","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Free Council doctrine teaches that it's better to spend power, which is rare but recoverable, than to carve off a bleeding chunk of your selfhood just to create an item."}]}
