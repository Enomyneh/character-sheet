The actual moment of uncertainty is brief, but its effects linger for the duration of the spell. The recipient becomes unsure of herself, making it difficult for her to complete whatever activities she's engaged in, or to initiate a new course of action. Though the sudden loss of confidence is imposed by the mage's will, it feels to the target like genuine self-doubt, even if it's out of character for her to second-guess herself. Each success subtracts one die from the target's dice pools on any attempt she makes to perform an instant or extended action for the duration of the spell, as she becomes weighed down and distracted by uncertainty -- until she succeeds at any roll, in which case the doubt is assuaged and the spell's effects expire. This spell cannot be cast upon the same target more than once per scene. If the target is a mage with Mind 1 or greater, she makes a reflexive Wits + Composure roll to sense the presence of mental manipulation.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Internal Struggle","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","RoteDicePool_Resisted":"Composure","roteDescription":"Sometimes a person's worst enemy is herself.
