He could cause a room to go pitch-black or light a dark cave from nothing but the tip of a glowing finger. Successes determine the created light's intensity (in a directional 30-degree arc). Conversely, one success is usually enough to extinguish a light, unless it's a light created by this spell or other magic, in which case the magic's Potency must be exceeded by this spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
