Astral travel requires deep concentration in the form of meditation. This spell makes a mind restless, incapable of concentrating on one thing for more than an instant. Targets affected by this spell subtract one die from all rolls requiring concentration per success on the spell roll. Examples include research, prolonged concealment or deception or meditation. In addition, the target must roll Wits + Composure to successfully  perform tasks that require concentration but do not normally call for rolls, such as studying to increase a Skill or patiently aiming a sniper rifle.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Wasted Research","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","roteDescription":"There are many things that a Guardian does not want others to learn. Though Wasted Research isn't a complete solution, this spell slows progress while the mage comes up with a real fix. In Astral Space, this spell is a good way to make sure that a person cannot follow one up or down through the strata -- or to prevent him from reaching the astral in the first place."}]}
