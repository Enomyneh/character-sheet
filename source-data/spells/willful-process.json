With this spell, a mage can perfect his ability to remember and take advantage of what he's learned. Likewise, a clever mage may apply this bit of sorcery to his interactions with others, allowing his previous experiences in dealing with others to drive his instinctual responses. The mage chooses a single Mental or Social Skill when this spell is cast. For each success on the spellcasting roll, that use of the skill is considered a rote action allowing his player to re-roll any dice that result in failures. This may only be used on non-magical Skill rolls. At Mind 3, the mage may grant this ability to others by touch.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium","roteName":"Powerful Recollection","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Academics","roteDescription":"Through a series of meditations and mental exercises, Mysterium scholars about to undertake extensive studies or research often use this rote to hone their personal skills.
