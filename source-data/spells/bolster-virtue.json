He felt, however, that calling forth his Virtue and empowering it was a different sort of spell, and he found a way to do it that produces surprising results. If the spell roll succeeds, the mage's Virtue comes to the fore and influences his actions for the duration of the scene. If the player spends Willpower on an action that serves the character's Virtue, the bonus the player receives is increased to five extra dice, rather than three. The Storyteller is the final arbiter on whether a given action is in line with the character's Virtue. At the end of the scene, the character regains all Willpower spent in service to the Virtue (that is, any Willpower for which he gained the bonus dice). At Mind 4, the mage can cast this spell on others.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Epee's Rote","roteName":"Best Foot Forward","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Empathy","roteDescription":"This rote is just as the spell, above."}]}
