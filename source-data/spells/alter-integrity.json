The player adds or subtracts one point per success achieved on the casting roll. Note that altering Durability with this spell also alters the object's Structure accordingly. At this level, the mage must touch the targeted object (although he can do so using forceps or other tools).

A car door can be rendered almost indestructible during a firefight, or a stone wall made brittle enough to be damaged with a single stout blow.
