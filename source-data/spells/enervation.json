The mage must first grab hold of the target, with a roll of Strength or Dexterity + Brawl - the target's Defense. If successful, he can cast this spell as an instant action in the following turn. (With Death 5, he can cast this spell at sensory range as an instant action. He needs Death 6 before he can add Space 2 for a sympathetic casting.) Each success subtracts one dot from the target's Strength Attribute, down to a minimum of 1. The maximum amount by which Strength can be lowered is equal to the mage's dots in the Death Arcanum. (Lowering Strength also lowers the target's Speed trait.)","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Weight Of The Grave","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"If she lacks the strength to lift a weapon, an enemy without recourse to other means is rendered virtually harmless. Thus do Arrow mages strike at their foes' power and secure victory. Of course, willworkers of all orders can find one use or another for this rote. Mysterium mages, for example, have been known to use one like it (Manipulation + Occult + Death) in order to slow pursuers while they flee."}]}
