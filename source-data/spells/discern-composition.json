Most technologically minded willworkers tend to see Matter in much the same way as most modern people: A scientifically grounded, predictable phenomenon. Other mages see things in a different light. Some describe \"threads\" interwoven throughout a \"Tapestry\" (\"This unique thread indicates the presence of gold,\" for example), while some speak of the Classical Elements -- Air (gas), Earth (solid), and Water (liquid). Success allows a mage to determine an object's Durability, Size, and Structure ratings.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Diagnostic Scan","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts or Science","roteDescription":"As many Council willworkers will gladly admit, the first step to changing a thing lies in understanding that thing. This rote is used to discern the fundamentals of an object's composition. Mysterium mages often use slightly different magic (Intelligence + Crafts or Science + Matter) to accomplish the same ends."}]}
