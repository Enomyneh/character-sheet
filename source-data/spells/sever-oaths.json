In the case of an oath sanctified through the Fate Arcanum, this rote is the only way to break from it safely, and Ladder mages make use of it when they must. Free Council willworkers bound to unpleasant oaths likewise feel little or no shame in use of such a rote. If the one to whom such a vow was made were worthy, there would be no need for mystic fetters ensuring complicity."}]}
