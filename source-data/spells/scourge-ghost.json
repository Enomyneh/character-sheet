Fear of this ghastly punishment inspires obedience in even the most willful phantom. Few tortures are as complete as this direct attack on the very substance of a ghost's soul. The ghost is unable to take actions when the mage concentrates on maintaining its ghastly torments. It must make a successful Power + Resistance roll before mustering the courage to defy the mage's instructions again. With the possible exception of utterly vile, deserving victims, the use of Scourge Ghost is an act of hubris, calling for a Wisdom degeneration roll, just as if the willworker had subjected a living victim to a session of appalling physical mistreatment.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Correct The Unliving","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Resistance","roteDescription":"Mysterium explorers use this rote to deter guardian ghosts, including the protectors of Artifacts and valuable Enchanted Items, from harming the mages. Ethical tomb-robbers employ it sparingly, keeping it active for the few moments required to make their point."}]}
