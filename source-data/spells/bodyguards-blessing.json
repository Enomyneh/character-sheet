This spell allows the mage to redirect a magical attack from its intended target to the mage. On the turn after this spell is cast, the next spell cast by the target is redirected to strike the caster of this spell. The mage may redirect any one spell with a Potency no higher than the number of successes gained on the casting roll.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Lightning Rod","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The tactical implications of this spell were not lost on the Arrows. Although they sometimes act in the capacity of bodyguards, the Arrows saw an opportunity to steal Shielding and healing spells from enemy mages. Timing, as well as a working knowledge of their opponent, is essential when applying the rote in this fashion. The Arrow must be able to predict how much damage their opponent is willing to take before resorting to a hasty healing or Shielding spell with a low enough Potency to be redirected."}]}
