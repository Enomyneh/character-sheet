This spell works for spoken words, written words, encoded signals, and concepts that exist only as thought. The mage must be able to perceive the medium in which the idea exists (meaning telepathy for thoughts in another's mind, for example) and may be limited in his ability to express a concept he can translate (like trying to tell something to a hyper-intelligent insectoid life form while lacking the appropriate mouth parts to speak its language). The obscurity of the language, or sheer alien-ness of the concepts might levy dice penalties from -1 to -3.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Theosophy Tradition Rote","roteName":"Thought Forms","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Annie Besant and CW Leadbeater pioneered the use of thought-forms: Pictorial representations of shapes and emotions, encoded in any music, language or work of art. The mage holds his pen tightly and meditates on the thing he wishes to translate for a moment. Then sketches the shape of the thoughts he sees in his mind's eye on a piece of paper. The resulting series of abstract shapes can be understood by anyone who sees them, at least for a little while."}]}
