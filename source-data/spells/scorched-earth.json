Use of this spell prepares a battlefield on which magic is not welcome. Casting this spell first requires the mage be inside the radius of a \"Dead Zone\". The \"Scorched Earth\" spell then increases the Potency of the magic Dead Zone by further leeching any remaining hints of magical energy from the physical surroundings of the area and strengthening the boundaries of the zone. In addition to the usual effects of a Dead Zone, every five successes gained on the extended casting roll increases the Potency of the Dead Zone by one category on the chart below. The caster needn't raise the zone to category 5 if she doesn't wish to, but may stop whenever she likes. Effects generated by increasing category are cumulative. Familiars, spirits and most other supernatural entities will not willingly enter an area of Scorched Earth, and even non-sapient entities will avoid the area instinctively. Casting this spell is an act of hubris requiring a degeneration roll for mages of Wisdom 4 or higher (roll three dice).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
