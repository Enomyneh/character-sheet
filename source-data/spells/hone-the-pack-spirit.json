This makes the pack receptive to more sophisticated commands and especially skilled at instinctive actions. This spell works only on base life forms with powerful social instincts. It works on lions, but not leopards; ants, but not houseflies. The pack accepts sophisticated commands because its ruling spirit is intelligent enough to interpret them, but it always resolves ambiguous instructions in a way that would allow the pack to act as it would in nature. Additionally, the mage cannot instruct individual pack members. Instead, she delivers orders to the pack as a whole. The pack spirit uses its own intelligence to carry out commands through pack members, assigning them individual tasks. The mage affects all targets of the same species within a defined area based on the number of successes scored. The spell must affect at least 2 targets or a swarm to work at all. The creatures under her thrall are more competent at instinctual tasks. Each level of Potency adds 1 die (maximum 5) to dice pools associated with these tasks. This benefits only actions that the base life form would perform in nature. Wolves get better at biting targets, but not at navigating their way through drain pipes.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
