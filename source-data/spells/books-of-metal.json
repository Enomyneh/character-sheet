Instead of books, Forge Masters inscribe their grimoires in metal. The glyphs of a grimoire could hide in the filigree of a bracelet or the chasing of a brooch, but some Powersmiths prefer to hammer their grimoires into the metal itself. Such a grimoire shows no visible sign of its nature: To read the grimoire, a mage requires both Matter 1 and Prime 1, to sense how the mystic pattern of the rote is coded into the crystal structure of the metal. Other than the use of Matter to impress the rote's pattern into an object rather than a written form, this spell works the same as Inscribe Grimoire.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Hephaistan Hallmark","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Craft","roteDescription":"A Forge Master brought the Free Council this rote, which enables a mage to turn any object of metal into a grimoire. The only visible sign to alert other mages to the hidden grimoire is a symbol stamped in the metal. The symbol itself is not magical; it is typically the mage's personal monogram. Many variations are possible. For instance, a Powersmith could bind a rote into a ring, re-learn the rote and so gain the grimoire's benefit to casting the rote whenever he wore the ring. Forge Masters in the Adamantine Arrow sometimes turn weapons into grimoires, so they can gain the same benefit by turning the rote mudra into a weapon-flourish. A few Guardians of the Veil use this rote to record their secrets."}]}
