While he could previously move things forward in time for a few turns using the Temporal Stutter spell, mastery of this level allows him to move an object far into the future, perhaps to keep it out of enemy hands or to ensure that only an heir will wield it. The number of successes determines how far into the future the object can be sent. The mage can opt to send it to any time between now and that allowed by his successes. The object appears at the future time in the exact same space it occupies in the present, unless Space 2 is added to locate it elsewhere. (See the Apportation spell.) The drawback to this spell is that, once cast, the object cannot be retrieved, except at the point in the future in which it appears. It is said that archmasters of Time have the power to reach forward and snatch back objects that have been sent forward.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
