This is most often cast to augment a cursed item, so that its owner cleaves to it even after its sinister purpose is revealed. The owner of an item with this spell woven into it must roll Resolve + Composure before making any attempt to destroy, dispose of or re-gift the item. This is contested by the spell's Potency. Owners who fail to beat the item's roll relent, and are unable to take further action in regard to the item for a number of days equal to the difference between the two sets of successes. If another party attempts to steal, destroy or remove the item from the owner's presence, the owner must roll the contested Resolve + Composure roll to allow this to happen. Otherwise, the owner uses any available means, including lethal force, to protect his precious item.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
