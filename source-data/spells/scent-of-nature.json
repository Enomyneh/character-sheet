To predators, the mage will smell like a stronger hunter and to prey the caster will smell non-threatening, like a member of its species. With a single success on the casting roll the mage simply becomes part of the background to natural creatures. The mage's scent changes depending upon what animal smells it and discourages it from attacking or fleeing. Animals will fight in self-defense, but otherwise take no hostile action toward the caster.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Tablets Of U'mat Rote","roteName":"Scent Of Nature","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Animal Ken","roteDescription":"This rote is performed just as its spell counterpart, above."}]}
