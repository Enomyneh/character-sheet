See the Familiar Merit for more details. The target must have purchased the Familiar Merit to cement the bond. Such a bond cannot be dispelled. Only one familiar may be pacted at a time to the same person. The caster must be able to see and speak to the desired spirit (see Spirit Tongue), and he must be able to touch it during each extended roll (see Gossamer Touch). A spirit in the Shadow World cannot be targeted by this spell. It must first be brought across the Gauntlet to become a Twilight spirit, either by coaxing or command (see Control Spirit). The spirit cannot be forced by magic to accept the familiar bond. It must enter willingly into such an agreement.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Soul-Bonding","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Socialize","roteDescription":"Supplemented by conversation, coaxing and even by threats and bribery, this rote enables a mage of the Mysterium to enter into a bond that ties a willworker to her familiar. Mages of every order make use of this magic, though, as familiars are popular among the Awakened."}]}
