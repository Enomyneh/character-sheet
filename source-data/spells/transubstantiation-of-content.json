With this spell, a mage can freely mix and convert data across any storage medium, provided the original object stores deliberate data in some fashion. With a successful casting of this spell, a mage can alter the medium of any data without altering the underlying meaning of the content. At the subtler end, this spell can recode electronic files so they must be read with a different operating system or translate a book written in one language to become written in another. More dramatic uses of the spell can condense a stack of tomes into a single flash drive or vice versa, though the total size of all objects before and after transformation cannot exceed 5, and the mage cannot create any data medium that he is not personally familiar with.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium","roteName":"Mutable Media","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"For every young Mysterium scholar looking to upgrade inherited texts to more technologically-driven and user-friendly forms, an older or more traditional member labors to distill useful knowledge from meaningless technobabble and superfluous gadgetry. In short, this rote facilitates cooperation between colleagues who might not otherwise have a frame of reference to understand each other's efforts."}]}
