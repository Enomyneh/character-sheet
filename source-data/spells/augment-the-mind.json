{"name":"Augment The Mind","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"210","primaryArcana":"Mind","arcanaRequirement":"Mind 3","requirements":[{"name":"Mind","dots":"3"}],"practice":"Perfecting","action":"Instant","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Covert","cost":"1 Mana","effect":"The mage can raise one of his Mental or Social Attributes. A single Mental or Social Attribute may be raised by one dot per success, up to a maximum of the caster's Mind Arcanum dots. For example, if a mage has Intelligence 3 and Mind 3 and three successes are achieved on this spell to boost his Intelligence, that trait becomes six dots for the spell's Duration. If four successes were rolled, he could still only boost Intelligence by three dots, since he has only Mind 3. Raising Resolve and/or Composure also raises Willpower dots, but these extra dots do not provide Willpower points. The boost raises a target's Willpower capacity but not her actual supply of points. In addition, the target's Willpower cannot exceed 10 dots, no matter how high his Resolve and/or Composure is boosted with this spell. Example: Arethusa uses Augment the Mind to boost her Resolve. She gets two successes on the casting, adding two dots to her Resolve. This also adds two dots to her Willpower. She does not, however, gain two extra Willpower points. Note that the same spell cast to boost a different Mental or Social Attribute does not combine with the first spell -- only the highest Potency spell takes effect. For example, if a mage boosts his Intelligence by two dots and then casts a spell boosting his Wits by one dot, only the first spell applies, since it has the higher Potency. (With the Mind 4 Supreme Augmentation spell, the mage can allocate successes among different Mental and Social Attributes.)","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Illuminating The Inner Temple","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Academics","roteDescription":"Guardians are called upon to be brilliant, forceful, and persuasive. Such acumen in all fields is not often found within a single individual. Indeed, Guardians must occasionally be far more brilliant, forceful or persuasive than any normal human being could possibly be. This rote enables such willworkers to become veritable Einsteins, rivaling the genius of even the most renowned intellect."}]}
