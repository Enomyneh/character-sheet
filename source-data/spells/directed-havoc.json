Whenever the user sets off an effect, however, this spell redirects the effect to affect a different target. When multiple alternative targets are available, the item reads the unauthorized user's mind, determining which target would displease her the most. A healing spell would therefore assist the thief's enemies, while called lightning would strike her, or one of her allies. This spell requires one success to install, but the mage may continue to add additional successes, if desired. When the defense mechanism is activated, the Storyteller rolls a dice pool equal to 10 or the number of successes scored during item enchantment, whichever is lower. This is reflexively contested by the unauthorized user's Resolve + Gnosis. If the item is successful, its effect is retargeted.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Bitter Irony","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"The rough poetic justice meted out by this item defense maintains a special appeal for the Free Council's more anarchic practitioners."}]}
