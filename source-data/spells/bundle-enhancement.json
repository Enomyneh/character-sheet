They count as one spell against the limit of spells the mage can actively maintain, and as one spell when the mage relinquishes them. The relinquishment cost may be the standard Willpower dot, or any alternative cost, such as those listed in Tome of the Mysteries, pp. 128-159. The Matter-based finishing spells are Alter Integrity, Alter Efficiency, and Alter Size. This spell need not be woven by the willworker responsible for the finishing spells. Separate finishing spells may be placed on the item by more than one willworker. In the case of a group effort, the mage casting this spell may designate herself, or any other willworker who contributed a finishing spell to the item, as the mage actively maintaining the new, combined spell. Once the designation is made, only that willworker may pay the cost to relinquish control of it. The designated mage is not obligated to do so, and may instead simply cancel the spell. In this event, all of the Matter-based finishing spells are also canceled, and a permanently Enchanted Item is never created.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Combination Of The Forms","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"Access to Enchanted Items is one of the perks of power for high-ranking climbers of the Silver Ladder.
