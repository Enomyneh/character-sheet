Such a creation possesses a degree of substance and appears to be a normal object of its type to Sleeping eyes, but is in reality a solidified illusion. The mage can create books, knives, chairs, stones, or any other lifeless, inanimate objects she can think of. These objects do not and cannot possess qualities such as conductivity, magnetism, or the like. Phantasmal wood does not float in water and it does not fuel a fire (though it can still be destroyed by such, it does not sustain the flame on its own). The spell creates an object of Size 5 or less. The phantasm has one point of Durability. It is fragile and breaks easily. The mage cannot create functional tools, weapons or armor at this level. To create a convincing illusion, a reflexive Intelligence + appropriate Skill roll is required, and excess successes on the casting add one die each to this roll. To simulate an animal, use Animal Ken. For an object, use Crafts. For a person, use Medicine or perhaps Empathy. At the Storyteller's discretion, magically \"dead\" areas may not contain enough ambient Mana to fabricate such an object without the expenditure of a point of Mana, but this should be the case only rarely.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Loom Of The Gods","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Craft","roteDescription":"When a Ladder mage wishes to impress others with a collection of rare antiques or artwork behind glass, she can craft them from the Prima Materia itself."}]}
