He can detect spatial distortions and manipulations. He is capable of discerning disturbances in the local fabric of space (typically caused by use of more advanced applications of this very Arcanum). He can detect when someone has altered the spatial axes of an area (for example, making a place larger on the inside than outside), used a location as the origin point or terminus for teleportation, or created (or overcome) a Space Ward. This sense transcends the normal five senses, but most mages tend to understand it in terms of sight. This sense is modified by the degree of the distortion/manipulation (the Storyteller might award a bonus for an extreme distortion or levy a penalty for a subtle one). See the information on Resonance for rules on scrutinizing magic with this spell.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Trailing The Long Stride","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Silver Ladder willworkers named this rote for its practical application in detecting the passage of those who had fled by means of the Space Arcanum. It is also frequently used to discern the presence of ongoing spatial warps, such as gateways or locations that have been altered indefinitely to be smaller, larger, or more convoluted than they should be. Mysterium mages use a similar rote (Wits + Occult + Space) to sense similar disturbances, as they know the objects they seek are sometimes hidden beyond such magic."}]}
