An electrical cord can be rendered completely non-conductive, while concrete can be made to conduct electricity like copper. The number of objects that can be affected increases with each success. Note that objects of up to Size 20 can be affected. The caster suffers dice penalties to affect larger objects. This includes such things as a concrete slab; unless additional Size factors are added, the mage affects a single slab of up to Size 20.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
