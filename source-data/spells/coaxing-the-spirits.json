{"name":"Coaxing The Spirits","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"245","primaryArcana":"Spirit","arcanaRequirement":"Spirit 1","requirements":[{"name":"Spirit","dots":"1"}],"practice":"Compelling","action":"Instant","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Covert","cost":"None","effect":"The mage can whisper to a spirit sleeping within a material object and ask for its aid, making it easier to use the object. The spirit does not awaken, but it does yield its power a bit, allowing the mage to pick a lock easier and faster, carve a wooden statue with more ease and grace, or even drive a car with more facility. Each success provides a +1 dice bonus on a single roll made within the spell's scene-long Duration. This bonus applies only to actions over which the object itself might conceivably have some sway, such as a car's ability to steer straight, but not a rock's power to be thrown more accurately (it has no control over the air).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Helping Hand","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Socialize","roteDescription":"Some Free Council mages understand that consciousness exists in more varied forms than most modern Sleepers know. Calling upon traditional wisdom, they use this rote to speak to the slumbering presence within most things, requesting aid in a task at hand. Silver Ladder mages are often more direct and forceful in casting their own version of this rote (Presence + Socialize + Spirit)."}]}
