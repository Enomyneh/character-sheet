Each success on the spell both reduces wound penalties suffered by the target by one and applies a bonus die to any Stamina roll to remain conscious. The target may continue to make Stamina rolls to stay conscious even after the right-most health box has been filled with lethal damage, but the spell then becomes Improbable. At Mind 2, the spell can affect only the mage casting it. At Mind 3, it may be cast on others.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"Battlefield Bliss","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","roteDescription":"A Seer that can remain active until the very last moment is a Seer with an extra chance to escape whatever calamity has befallen her.
