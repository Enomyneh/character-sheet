See the information on Resonance for rules on scrutinizing items. With an exceptional success, the mage can tell if the enchanted item is cursed or has other exceptional circumstances (deleterious or benign) connected to its ownership or use. The effect lasts for one scene, during which extended Intelligence + Occult rolls can be made to examine the enchanted item. Ten minutes' time per roll; target number is equal to twice the enchanted item's Merit dots.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Artifact Hunt","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"No weapon is truly useful until its wielder comprehends its nature. Members of the Adamantine Arrow use this magic to learn the capabilities of enchanted items with which they come into contact, and to see if there are any strings attached to use of such items. Given that a misunderstood Artifact is a dangerous Artifact, all orders make use of this rote."}]}
