{"name":"Grim Sight","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"134","primaryArcana":"Death","requirements":[{"name":"Death","dots":"1"}],"practice":"Unveiling","action":"Instant","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Covert","cost":"None","effect":"The mage gains Mage Sight, perceiving the supernatural through the lens of Death. He sees the weight of death around a person -- not his likelihood of death (unless the subject has a terminal illness), but how often he has rubbed shoulders (knowingly or not) with the dead or dying. Those who have suffered the loss of many loved ones or who have killed many people tend to bear heavy burdens. This sight also applies to things or places. See the information on Resonance for rules for scrutinizing magic with this sight. A +1 dice bonus is gained on perception and scrutiny rolls to sense vampiric Disciplines, Devotions, and rituals.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Aura Of Gloom","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Those whose lives have been touched in certain ways by Death can be manipulated through that contact. Using this rote, a mage can perceive another's grief through a recent loss, and use this knowledge to manipulate that person's emotional vulnerability. It can be used to identify murderers who have otherwise concealed their crimes from all knowledge (although this rote reveals no details about the murder, only that the target has blood on his hands). Some members of the Adamantine Arrow use a similar rote to size up a person as a potential threat."}]}
