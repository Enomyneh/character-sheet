The resulting artificial body is sometimes known as a proto-homunculus, or proto for short. The large number of successes required to work this spell can be racked up over time, with multiple instances of the spell. Any interval may pass between castings of the spell, provided that any organic or perishable components of the form are kept from decaying, either by magical means or through simple refrigeration. The Mana cost must be paid for each casting. Paradox, which may destroy or reverse one's progress, remains a risk with each session.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
