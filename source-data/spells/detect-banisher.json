{"name":"Detect Banisher","sourceBook":"Banishers","sourcePage":"62","primaryArcana":"Prime","arcanaRequirement":"Prime 1","requirements":[{"name":"Prime","dots":"1"}],"practice":"Knowing","action":"Instant","duration":"Concentration","aspect":"Covert","cost":"None","effect":"The Banisher can recognize the subtle distinctions in aura between normal mages and those of his ilk. Banishers, for whatever reason, have magical signatures that are slightly different from those of other mages. While some Banishers refuse to work together, and are just as willing to kill each other as their foes, others long for companionship and backup. This spell allows a mage to see the cracks in a Banisher's aura and feel the chill from the Abyss within. Non-Banishers mages can use this spell, as well, but they suffer a -2 penalty on the attempt. Use of this spell is also believed to make mages more susceptible to becoming Banishers, though this might just be paranoid rumor. Any use of this spell adds the target's Abyssal Resonance Merit dots, if any, to the attempt (making mages with this Merit easier to detect). Note, though, that casting this spell upon a target with Abyssal Resonance 2 makes the spell vulgar in aspect.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Friendly Faces","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits + Composure","roteDescription":"More than one Banisher over the years has developed this rote, and in larger cults, it's not too unlikely that someone winds up learning or creating it.
