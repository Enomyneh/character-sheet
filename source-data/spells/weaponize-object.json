By force of will, he sharpens the object's edges, shifts its balance, or toughens its exterior just enough to make it serviceable for combat. Though the object displays no visible change, the object's composition is altered so that the mage can use it as a weapon without suffering the usual -1 penalty imposed on attacks made with improvised weapons. Furthermore, the object's Damage is calculated by the higher of its Durability or Size, rather than the lower. Almost any object could be used for this purpose, as long as the mage can pick the object up and move it (the mage's Strength must exceed the weapon's Size rating, or he'll suffer a -1 penalty on attacks).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"The Weapon At Hand","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"An Arrow who uses this rote is guaranteed an arsenal wherever he goes: A broom handle becomes a quarterstaff, a letter opener becomes a dagger, a length of clothesline becomes a whip."}]}
