This spell is like Transmute Earth, except that it can be cast on precious substances or materials that are rare or valuable (bearing metaphysical weight based on the importance the mage's culture assigns to them). The caster cannot alter the substance's state (liquid or solid) unless he combines the casting with Lesser Transmogrification.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Fool's Gold","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult or Science","roteDescription":"Guardian mages use this rote to punish those who think they can buy their way out of everything, rendering riches into dead leaves or clay."}]}
