Grass grows and knots around the target's feet, tree branches catch and snag at clothing and limbs, and vines spiral and twist around the target in an ever tightening grasp. This rote functions properly only in areas with abundant plant life. Areas with less than optimum conditions impose a penalty on the casting roll from -1 (mild drought) to -5 (near desert). If no flora exists in the area, the spell will simply not function. Each success on the casting roll reduces the target's Speed by 2. When this spell is cast as an extended spell, the flora slowing the target continues to creep up his body attempting to hold him in place. Treat this as a Grapple attack with total successes on the extended roll acting as the Strength of the attack. If the target breaks the grapple, all successes are lost. If the total number of successes to grapple the target is ever greater than twice his Size, the target is considered Immobilized. Casting Gaia's Hold as an extended spell costs one Mana.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Cage The Rabbit","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"Many people would rather flee than submit themselves to the proper authority of an Arrow fulfilling his oath.
