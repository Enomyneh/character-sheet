With the right words, a mage can give a group of friends and followers the will to succeed above and beyond their own capacity. The mage casts this spell on one or more people. The actual casting takes the form of a pep-talk, which can be a few words or a long, involved speech. A long speech can be performed as an extended casting, although a weak mage may discover that talking for hours on end may prove counterproductive, as her audience loses attention. The talk has to be directed toward psyching up the subjects of the spell for a specific purpose, which could be anything from winning a fight or a sports match to finding an elusive fact over a night of frenzied research in ancient tomes. The spell enables the mage to grant one Willpower point to the subject(s) of the spell, which can only be used for actions related to the purpose of the spell and which, once used, can't be regained. These points should be recorded separately from the character's own Willpower points. This spell can only affect any given individual once per scene.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
