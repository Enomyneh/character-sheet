They become Twilight beings until they exit the gateway. While Twilight, they can touch ghosts, pick up ghostly objects, or read tomes hidden there. They can also engage in physical or magical combat with ghosts, damaging their Corpus. Conversely, wrathful shades might physically lash out at visitors, causing them harm. One person of Size 5 or less can pass through the gate per turn (larger people can spend two turns squeezing through). Each success on the casting allows the mage to widen the gate so that one additional person can pass through per turn. With Death 4, the mage can cast this spell as an instant action and can also limit who can enter (or exit) the gate.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Calling The Crossroads","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"While it is one thing to speak to the dead and learn their lore, it is another entirely to physically become like a ghost and employ one's senses while in a ghostly state. Certain locations inaccessible from the material realm can also be explored by means of this rote, enabling a Mysterium willworker to discover relics and knowledge perhaps lost for ages."}]}
