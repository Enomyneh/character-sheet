The spell reduces a target's ability to stay calm while simultaneously provoking feelings of rage, inspiring her to attack. If she is unaware of the spell, the target focuses on the most likely cause of frustration -- which can be a person or an object -- and lashes out at it, attacking it for the duration of the spell. If the target is aware of the magic, the object of her wrath will likely be the mage himself. Any Morality checks called for by the target's actions are resolved at the end of the spell's duration. Certain supernatural creatures are prone to berserk rages. Werewolves and vampires targeted successfully by this spell must make Death Rage or frenzy checks, with successes on the spell as the level of provocation.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"The General's Whisper","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","roteDescription":"The General is the Exarch of anger, frustration and violence.
