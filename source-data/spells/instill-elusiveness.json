The item teleports to a new location within its range of movement. If there's a hidden or inaccessible location within that radius, the item goes there. Otherwise it moves as far away as it can without re-materializing within a solid object. The item may move in a random direction, or make a series of consistent hops in the same direction. Although the item is not blessed with intelligence, the object does appear to calculate its moves to engineer maximum exasperation in the interloper. The item's range of movement depends on the Mana spent on the original enchantment. The target number is increased by five successes per point of Mana spent. The teleportation effect evokes Disbelief in Sleeper witnesses.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
