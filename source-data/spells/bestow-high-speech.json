Mortals, Sleepwalkers included, cannot comprehend High Speech in any form. This aspect of the Lie is usually a blessing -- the Awakened can keep secrets safe from the minds that would destroy them. But Atlantean's automatic concealment is not always an advantage. A target of this spell can perceive the true form of High Speech for the duration; he can also understand and speak the language as if he possessed the High Speech Merit. This spell can be cast on one of the Awakened without using Prime.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Words From The Isle","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Mystagogues use this secret rote on their most trusted Sleepwalker research assistants. It allows a Sleepwalker to read books written in High Speech, as many of the older and more valuable tomes are in the Atlantean language. Otherwise, many mages would be without research assistance when looking for the one clue to an important mystery. The Mysterium assumes that the Guardians of the Veil would consider this rote a betrayal of the Veil and attempt to destroy all record of its existence. The order therefore keeps Words from the Isle a great secret."}]}
