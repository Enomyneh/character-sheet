Instead, the willworker accomplishes the relinquishment by making the Enchanted Item a focus for unspecified future ill-fortune. This spell may not be used to relinquish control over curse spells. A special dice pool, the Misfortune pool, is attached to the item. Each time its user scores a failure in any task employing an Enchanted Item's powers or equipment bonus, one die is added to that pool. (When the item is used for an action that would not normally require a roll, the user must instead roll the original willworker's Death + Gnosis at the time of item creation.) Before using an item with a Misfortune greater than zero, the item's user first reflexively rolls its Misfortune. On a failure, the item remains sound, and can be used as normal during the current turn. On a success, the item can still be used during the current turn, but at a dice penalty equal to the number of Misfortune successes. On an exceptional success, a random curse permanently instills itself in the item. The Storyteller chooses an appropriate curse given the narrative circumstances, or rolls one die and consults the following chart, adding one to the result for each curse already instilled in the item.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
