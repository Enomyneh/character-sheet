Similarly, Hermes (for the Greeks) or Mercury (for the Romans) was associated with crossroads, as was the Christian St. Simon. Magic or Mana gathers here in larger clusters than at normal crossings, for crossroads are not just where two roads meet. They are where two ley lines or lines of power intersect one another, called a \"node\" by mages. Using a wand made specifically for this purpose, the mage can locate the nearest ley line node. Successes apply to the spell's duration factors. While the spell is active, the mage can make instant-action Wits + Occult perception rolls to scrutinize the immediate area's Resonance (within sensory range) for the tale-tell signs of a node, where two or more ley lines meet.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Appalachian Hoodoo Tradition Rote","roteName":"Find Crossroads","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"This rote must employ a wand created specifically for this purpose, though it can be used over and over so long as it remains dedicated to finding crossroads. The wand must be made from a tree made by the natural joining of two saplings of different types. It must lie beneath a full moon for three consecutive nights in three consecutive months. When looking for the crossroads, the mage just speak the name of whichever crossroads deity or saint she holds dearest, followed by \"show me the way of power\" three times before starting out."}]}
