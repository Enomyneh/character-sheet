{"name":"Call Lightning","sourceBook":"Mage: The Awakening","sourcePage":"168","primaryArcana":"Forces","arcanaRequirement":"Forces 3","requirements":[{"name":"Forces","dots":"3"}],"practice":"Weaving","action":"Instant and aimed","duration":"Lasting","aspect":"Covert","cost":"None","effect":"The mage calls down lightning from a stormy sky to strike a target of his choice. He cannot conjure lightning from nothing (at least, not at this level). He can bring down lightning only from a pre-existing storm or a storm he causes through the Change Weather spell. The mage does not directly attack a person or object with this spell; he instead calls and directs a bolt of lightning toward the target of his choice. The bolt inflicts three points of bashing damage plus one per success (two successes therefore inflict five points of bashing damage). The target must be somewhere that lightning could reasonably strike. Successive uses of this spell within the same scene against the same target (or even other nearby targets) might be considered Improbable by Sleeper witnesses. A third strike (and each successive strike thereafter) in the same turn is vulgar.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Heavenly Wrath Fist","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Strength","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"Making the mudra-fist of Heavenly Wrath, the Adamantine Arrow gathers to himself the aspect of the avenging heavens, smiting that which is base and unenlightened, that it may be purified -- either in enlightenment, or in destruction. The Imago of this spell involves the target standing upon a copper dais inscribed with the Atlantean symbols for \"justice,\" \"punishment,\" and \"righteousness.\" Factor Bonuses: Wearing the traditional three copper rings of the Heavenly Wrath Fist (+1 factor); Physically striking someone in punishment for hurting another or breaking the law (+1 Potency factor if cast within two turns of the strike)."}]}
