Like any human, a mage may grow tired and fall asleep, even when he does not wish to. A successful casting allows the mage to remain clear-headed for the duration of the spell, regardless of how long he has been awake before casting the spell. During this period, each success rolled in the casting allows the mage to ignore one die of penalties caused by fatigue, but only for mental or social related actions, not physical actions. He must still roll to stay awake every six hours, per the rules for \"Fatigue. This spell cannot be used consecutively within the same week more times than the mage's rating in the Mind Arcanum. Mages who add two dots of Life to the casting can ignore one die per success of fatigue-based dice penalties when performing physical actions.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"No Rest For The Wicked","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"The Mysteries won't protect themselves, and as much as a Guardian of the Veil may need her sleep, it is rare that there is another Guardian available to take up the burden. Too many opportunities have been lost because of a night's rest. Instead, Guardians use this rote to keep themselves functional and awake longer than they usually could be."}]}
