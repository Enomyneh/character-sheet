Obscure or rare diseases or conditions might levy a dice penalty to the roll (the rare hemorrhagic Ebola virus might be -3). The time per roll is one turn, and the target number depends on the condition of the subject. Only one success is needed to examine a perfectly healthy specimen, but a small cancerous tumor might need five or more successes to detect. The Storyteller should make the roll, so that the player doesn't know when his character misses a telling sign of illness.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Root Out Illness","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","roteDescription":"Guardians occasionally come across strange illnesses in the course of their work, or are forced to quickly diagnose injuries caused by any number of malign entities. Adamantine Arrow mages use this rote for similar reasons, assessing injuries sustained in the defense of their charges."}]}
