Each success allows the mage to channel one Mana point from a source to his own Mana pool, up to a maximum of his Prime dots. The mage must touch the source (with Prime 4, he can channel within sensory range, and with Prime 5 he can use Space 2 for sympathetic range). Tass can be drawn upon for its Mana with this spell, meaning that it can potentially serve as a form of currency. The mage must touch the tass to channel from it (with Prime 4, he can channel from it at sensory range). For each point of Mana siphoned out of tass, subtract one point from the tass' Mana and its Structure. If it is siphoned to zero Mana or Structure, the tass collapses back into the Tapestry. An enchanted item that holds its own Mana stores (such as certain imbued items and Artifacts) can also be touched, and one Mana is channeled per success, up to a maximum of the caster's Prime dots.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Taoist Tradition Rote","roteName":"Thunder Meditation","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","roteDescription":"The mage uses a meditative oblation to collect Mana during a thunderstorm. The rote enables her to imbue the Mana with elemental resonances and store it in her viscera, so that motes (points) with different resonances do not mix. This gives the Taoist reservoirs of Mana with whatever resonance she needs for a particular working. Each success changes the resonance of one mote and binds it to a particular organ."}]}
