Mages use this spell to trap rivals inside an astral stratum with no ability to escape. Under the effects of this spell, a target cannot move in or out of Astral Space at all. The target has freedom within the astral realm or stratum he currently occupies, but he cannot move between strata or attempt to leave Astral Space. Furthermore, he cannot be roused from outside until the spell ends.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Mindtrap","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"Guardians do some of their most sensitive and secret work inside others' minds. When another mage follows Guardians into Astral Space, this allows a Guardian to trap the mage and move on to the private astral realms. Guardians and Silver Ladder mages use this rote (Silver Ladders roll Presence + Expression + Mind) to condemn other mages to serve terms trapped in Astral Space, usually inside their own minds."}]}
