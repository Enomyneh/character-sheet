The successes achieved in the spellcasting roll designate the level of protection. When possessed of, acting under the parameters of, or within the presence of a godsend, the spell's successes are subtracted from any damage he suffers (starting with aggravated damage first, then lethal, then bashing). In the case of a place made into a godsend, the default area affected is of one-yard radius or five cubic yards of volume.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Secret Strength, The","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Survival","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Resolve + Gnosis","roteDescription":"Some believe that members of the Mysterium are eclectic scholars unsuited for the rigors of combat. In some cases, that sentiment may ring true. By means of this rote, however, even the most retiring researcher can hold her own in dangerous situations, defended by Fate itself.
