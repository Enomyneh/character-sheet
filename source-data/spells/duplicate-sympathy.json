The sympathetic connection being duplicated must be known to the caster, either by common knowledge (\"that between you and your mother\") or by use of the Interconnections spell, but the identity of what the connection is need not be. The strength of the connection being duplicated determines the target number of successes. Upon successful completion of the spell, the recipient gains a \"Described\" connection to the same thing as the connection being duplicated, which lasts for the Duration of the spell. Most casters then cast \"New Threads\" to increase the level of the new connection on a Lasting basis.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
