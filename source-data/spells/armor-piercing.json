The object gains the armor-piercing quality on the next dice roll made using the object. Each extra success affects the object for one additional roll. The player cannot choose which rolls are affected; each successive roll bestows the benefit until the number of affected rolls has been used or the scene ends, whichever comes first. Armor piercing also applies against an attacked object's Durability. The amount of armor points the object can ignore depends on the caster's Matter proficiency. Instead of affecting a single object, the mage can affect a number of bullets: One bullet per success. He can double this number for each additional Target factor he adds to the casting, with a cumulative penalty of -2 per extra Target factor. In the case of autofire, a short burst with the Armor-Piercing spell cast upon at least one of its three bullets gains the full effect of the spell for that burst. For a medium burst, at least five of the 10 bullets must be subject to this spell for the burst to ignore armor. For a long burst, 10 of the 20 bullets fired in the burst must be subject to this spell for the entire burst to ignore armor.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
