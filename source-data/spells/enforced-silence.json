At her command, vocal chords seize up, the tongue is paralyzed, the lips fail to shape sounds; as a result, the target is unable to generate any sound louder than breathing. Not even hisses or tongue clicks are possible. The target can cough (and so cannot be made to choke while this spell is active), but his coughs sound like barely audible wheezing. The spell works on any living being that creates noise with its breath. With one success, a single target's vocal apparatus is silenced; extra successes allow multiple targets to be affected. Those affected by the spell can still eat, breathe and swallow normally. Note that most animals and people will experience some distress upon finding they can't use their voice. Because the spell draws on the Life Arcanum, the spell won't function on nonliving beings such as spirits, ghosts, vampires, or the walking dead. If the mage also has Mind 3, he may prevent the target from speaking about a specific topic or articulating a specific word or phrase. The target can talk normally unless he tries to utter the specified words, or speak about the forbidden topic, even obliquely.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
