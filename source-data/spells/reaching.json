While this contact can be perilous (such as when in the vicinity of a dangerous spirit with many natural weapons), it can also enable a mage to interact with the spirit realm when he does not want to cross the Gauntlet or is incapable of doing so. The mage could, for example, easily pick up a Shadow Realm object and move it to somewhere more advantageous (provided no Shadow Realm entity grabs hold of it and tries to take it away), or he could place a comforting hand upon an allied spirit when it is anxious or in pain. The willworker can also use this ability to strike a dangerous being with his fists (or with a weapon awakened with  the Rouse Spirit spell) and (hopefully) remain beyond its ability to effect in kind. This spell also allows the mage to reach into the material realm from the Shadow Realm.

This rote grants a willworker the ability to pierce the barrier between spirit and flesh. Mysterium mages often use their own version of the rote (Wits + Athletics + Spirit) to freely interact with the ephemeral environment."}]}
