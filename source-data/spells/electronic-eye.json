By touching a storage medium (or its casing, such as a computer hard drive), the mage can \"read\" its stored contents as if having access to a machine capable of reading it, such as a computer. The user reads the information at normal human speeds, just as if reading it from a computer screen or listening to it through a speaker. Information in the form of programming (computer code) is recognizable as such, and the reader can disregard it to skim for text and graphics information. The mage cannot \"run\" software, but can generally determine what it does by reading its code and making an Intelligence + Computer roll.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Data-Reader","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Computer","roteDescription":"Electronic storage of information is quite useful, except when the machinery breaks down. This techn&eacute; is an essential \"backup\" for a crashed drive or a damaged disk reader. It's also useful for accessing information the caster shouldn't be able to access at all or for finding \"hidden\" files on storage disks."}]}
