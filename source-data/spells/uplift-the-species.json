Without other magics, such altered creatures have only the most basic instinctual programming of the life forms into which they\"re changed. A planarian changed into a cat does not possess the cat's superior intelligence, and a patch of moss transformed into a snake is apt to lie exactly where it is altered and act only if harmed or otherwise forced to react. At this level, the mage must touch the target. With Life 5, he can cast this spell at sensory range.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Genetic Tampering","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Stamina","roteDescription":"Free Council mages sometimes use this rote to create strange pets with the docility of lower life forms but the bodies of dogs or cats."}]}
