A mage with Death 3 can sever a soul, and certain spirits have powers that allow them to steal souls. The mage must have the soul and its original owner at hand, unless he has a Space 2 sympathetic connection to both (or a Space Portal that transcends distance, allowing him to teleport one to the other). Retrieving the soul might be dangerous, since it usually requires confronting the being that took it and who might have wards protecting it from being snatched away. The target number is one success per week the soul has been gone, but the spell's effect is lasting. If the stolen soul has been attached to a new body, the mage must first use the Fate 4 Destroy Bindings spell to detach it before he can restore it to its rightful owner.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Restoring The Stolen Light","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Empathy","roteDescription":"Not all of a Guardian's duties are unpleasant, though it might sometimes seem that way.
