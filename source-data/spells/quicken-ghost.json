Supplemented by this rote, they can accomplish feats far beyond their already impressive capabilities. Mysterium mages sometimes bribe the dead by means of this rote. A Guardian (Resolve + Occult + Death) may bring a given ghost's anchor along with him to another ghost's haunt, and then fortify his interloping shade to drive out the resident spirit."}]}
