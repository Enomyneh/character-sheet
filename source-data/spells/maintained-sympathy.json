This is usually enough -- a mage's best weapons in Astral Space are his spells and his wits -- but sometimes it helps to have an edge. This spell manifests representations of real-world sympathies in the astral for the mage to use. Each success allows the mage to designate one item (such as a lock of hair or an old book) that manifests with him in Astral Space. For the spell's Duration, he can use the items for their sympathetic connections. This spell also allows the mage to manifest dedicated magical tools in the astral -- useful when traveling to realms where Paradoxes threaten. Even when a mage needs no sympathetic connections to the real world, having tokens of other astral companions makes it easier to contact them using standard sympathetic magic.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Kit Bag","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Survival","roteDescription":"Soldiers know the value of being prepared.
