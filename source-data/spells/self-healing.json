Each success heals one point of bashing or lethal Health damage (the rightmost wound on the Health chart is healed first). This spell can be cast covertly, although Sleepers who witness it need some method of explaining its miraculous effects so the spell won't seem Improbable; use of medical gear might be enough to convince them. With Life 3, the mage can heal aggravated wounds, but the spell must be cast with a vulgar aspect.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Salve The Wounds Of Battle","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Dexterity","roteDicePool_Skill":"Medicine","roteDescription":"No warrior goes her entire life without a scratch. The mages of the Adamantine Arrow use this rote to mend flesh and bone when skill fails or luck takes a turn for the worse. Such willworkers are careful to grit their teeth through the pain, so that a cursory inspection (and casting) can reveal even grievous hurts (to the eyes of the unenlightened, at any rate) to have been merely \"flesh wounds.\" Guardians of the Veil who practice such arts often prefer slightly calmer surroundings for their healing magics (Intelligence + Medicine + Life) than the frantic circumstances in which Arrow mages often find themselves."}]}
