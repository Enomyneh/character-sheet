With this rote, the Arrow can literally paralyze his foe with fear. The precise manifestation of this is up to the mage himself: He may cause his foe's strength to abandon him from fear, or set his hands and feet to quaking or cause his enemy's breath and very constitution to abandon him. The Imago of this spell involves the mighty shout from the Heavens utterly wracking his foe, cracking bones and blasting him with Supernal power drawn down from the Watchtower of the Stone Book. Factor Bonuses: Bellowing a powerful war-cry (+1 Potency or Target factor); Striking down an ally of the target's within the past two turns (+2 Potency or Duration factors)."}]}
