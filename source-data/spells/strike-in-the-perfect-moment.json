She can sense moments when her opponent isn't prepared to defend against an attack. If she spends a point of Mana while attacking with a weapon or unarmed strike during the duration of the spell, reduce her opponent's Defense by her Time dots. This benefit does not affect the benefits of armor or Shielding Practice spells except for Time-based protection. It does reduce the defensive benefits of supernatural powers that provide increased speed or raw agility, but not those that protect the user by virtue of increased toughness, mental misdirection, or any other means. This spell doesn't benefit ranged attacks.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Shikake","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Weaponry","roteDescription":"An Arrow who uses this rote learns how to strike when opponents are unprepared to respond.
