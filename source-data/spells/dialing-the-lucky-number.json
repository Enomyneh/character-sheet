If this spell is used on a telephone that remembers the numbers dialed, it is a good way to find out someone's cell phone number. The ultimate target is under no compulsion to pick up the telephone, although most people do, and the telephone connection is completely mundane, so if the mage and target do not share a common language the spell is of little use. There is also no guarantee that the target will be the closest person to the phone -- only that the phone closest to the target will ring -- thus he may not answer. This is not sympathetic magic, as the target is the phone system, which is being manipulated, not the remote person who will hear the telephone ring. One use of the spell allows only one phone call. It is, however, almost impossible for repeated use of this spell to become improbable. The caster is simply making a number of phone calls.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council","roteName":"Cold Calling","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"The trick isn't to tell the phone lines where to call, like you usually do. The trick is telling them who to call and then letting them do their thing. You lend them your knowledge of the Space Arcanum and let them work it out. Listen carefully and you can hear phones find each other."}]}
