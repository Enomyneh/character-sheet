One success is sufficient to ruin every electrical device within the spell's radius (destroying the Structures of all electronic components). (Certain military devices specifically made to resist EMP are immune). A simple success affects a one-yard radius. Excess successes spread the pulse over a larger area. The effect is lasting, although devices can be repaired.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
