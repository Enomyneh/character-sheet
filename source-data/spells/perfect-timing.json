If she wants to throw a punch, she knows how and where to strike with the greatest possible (mundane) precision and force. Or if she wants to convince someone of something, she knows the most opportune instant in which to speak. Each success grants the mage a single extra die in the next roll that has to -- or is chosen to -- be made. This does not include spellcasting rolls. If the next roll is for a spell (perhaps the mage needs to quickly cast a countermagic), the character loses the benefit.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Strike True","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence + Composure","roteDescription":"Mages of the Adamantine Arrow who master this rote find that they need strike only once in order to fell their enemies.
