She \"just happens\" to stumble at the right moment, causing a bullet to miss her, or she unthinkingly turns just the right way so that a knife slides off her jacket rather than piercing it. The mage gains one point of armor per dot she possesses in the Fate Arcanum. By spending one Mana, the Duration can be made to last for one day. Most mages cast such a shielding spell at the beginning of the day, as part of a morning ritual. Successes are used to combat attempts to dispel the shield. Note that this magical armor applies against attempts to grapple the caster (both his Defense and Fortune's Protection armor are subtracted from the grappler's dice pool when he attempts to achieve a hold on the mage), but it does not protect against attempts by an opponent to overpower and/or inflict damage once he has managed to grapple the mage.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Untouchable","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Athletics","roteDescription":"Not all threats to the hidden society of the Awakened stem from supernatural sources. A well-aimed tire iron (perhaps swung by a frightened Sleeper who has seen too much) can prove just as deadly to a Guardian as any ancient curse, so protective countermeasures are sometimes in order. Mages of the Adamantine Arrow also favor a variant of this rote (Resolve + Athletics + Fate) for self-defense while about their order's assigned tasks."}]}
