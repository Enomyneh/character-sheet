The mage may choose to simply induce a random change in the lights or try to specify which lights will change to which color. This can be useful for more than just cutting down the length of the mage's morning commute; at least one cabal is known to use this spell to trap their enemies in massive traffi c jams, then assassinate them while they sit, vulnerable, in their car. The mage can affect one traffic light (or any similar electronic signaling device) per success. If he simply wishes all targeted traffic lights to change randomly, no  further roll is required. Specifying a change, however, requires an Intelligence + Science roll, with a -1 penalty per light beyond the first. The mage may continue to change all affected lights for the duration of the spell, as a simple refl exive action to cause a random change or with another Wits + Academics roll (also a reflexive action) to specify the change.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Drag Race","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"Sometimes, you just need to get the hell away.
