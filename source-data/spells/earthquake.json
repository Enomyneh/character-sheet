This spell inflicts damage upon structures such as buildings within its targeted area (a five-yard area with one success) equal to the spell's successes. Dexterity + Athletics, minus the spell's successes, is rolled for living beings to remain standing. In uncommon cases, those in the area (especially those who fall down) may suffer a Health wound or two of damage, almost always bashing (Storyteller's discretion). Being in a narrow stairwell filled with plummeting debris may involve more damage, as might being beneath a falling statue, but such occurrences are judged on a case-by-case basis.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
