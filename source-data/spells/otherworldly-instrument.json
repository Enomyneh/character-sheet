The willworker can create a basic tool for use by a spirit or ghost, such as a bar to use as a lever, a claw hammer for pounding in or removing nails or even a club that the entity could use to attack others of its kind. This spell's Potency determines the equipment bonus of the incorporeal item created, up to a maximum of the caster's Death, Spirit or Gnosis, whichever is lowest. This item may only be used by a ghost or spirit, unless the mage possesses other magics that allow her to interact with such otherworldly constructs.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Free Council Rote","roteName":"Immaterial Artifice","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Dexterity","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"During the course of experimentation, Libertines occasionally find cause to work with Twilight-bound entities; this rote enables Libertines to craft functional equipment for their physically insubstantial assistants."}]}
