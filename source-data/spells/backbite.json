The mage alters the configuration of a weapon so that it doesn't attack a target -- the weapon attacks its own user. A gun misfires, exploding in the hands of the wielder. A bow's string slices open one's forearm. A knife turns out to have a razor-sharp grip. When someone attempts to use a weapon that has had the Backbite spell cast upon it, the person suffers her attack successes as damage. The user's Defense does not apply, though Armor might, depending on the circumstances. (An armored vest will not provide defense when picking up a Backbite enchanted knife, though the vest will protect against a backbiting gun.) At this level, the casting mage must touch the jury-rigged object that is the target of the spell. With Matter 4, he can cast this spell at sensory range. Adding Space 2 to the spell allows the mage to affect weapons out of normal sensory range, useful before breaking into a place with armed guards.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Misfire","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Firearms or Weaponry (depending on the type of weapon affected)","roteDescription":"The Guardians of the Veil have been known to let themselves be captured and disarmed, knowing that their weapons cannot be used against them (until they cancel the spell)."}]}
