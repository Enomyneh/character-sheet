Most mages learn the proper pronunciation of the ancient language during their apprenticeship and rarely seriously misspeak a word during the casting of a spell. The language of Atlantis is the language of power, and when High Speech is spoken incorrectly, that power has a negative impact on spellcasting. This spell causes the words of High Speech to stumble out of the mouth of the target, slightly changing their meaning. With a single success on the casting roll, the target mage using High Speech to bolster a spell will suffer a -2 dice penalty on his casting roll. The target may realize he has misspoken by succeeding on a reflexive Intelligence + Occult roll. A mage who realizes his mistake may choose to abort the spell, but must still count the chanting as his action for the turn.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Tongue Tied","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"During his extended surveillance of order mages in Miami, a solitary Banisher noted the mages frequently chanted in an unknown language to enhance their spells.
