At this level of expertise, she can only mitigate or negate those small factors that add up against her (the crooked house dealer suddenly realizes that he didn't stack the deck quite as well as he had originally imagined, for example), rather than actively setting events in her favor. Most mages who read possibilities in this way have a preference for either determinism or chaos, but there are quite a few who do not care to put their own spin on the matter and take such things at face value. At any time within the spell's Duration, the mage can spend time \"aiming\" any action, reducing dice-pool penalties turn by turn (as an instant action per turn) on a one-for-one basis, to a maximum of three dice worth of penalties. This effect can negate only penalties, however, and may not result in any kind of bonus to dice pools.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Eye Of The Storm","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"In the course of defending allied Awakened against their enemies, willworkers of the Adamantine Arrow must occasionally deal with strange circumstances and maddening distractions such as high winds, driving rain, or the pain of a grievous injury. This rote enables such a warrior-mage to focus fully on the task at hand. Mages of the Mysterium also use this magic (Resolve + Occult + Fate) to concentrate when their explorations into the secrets of the occult lead them into hazardous situations in which lack of focus can prove deadly."}]}
