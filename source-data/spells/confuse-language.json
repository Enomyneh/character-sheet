She can't read, write (or type), speak, or understand spoken language. This deficiency even extends to all forms of sign language. To a victim of this spell, language doesn't look or sound any different -- she just doesn't understand it. When she tries to talk, she babbles incoherently. When she tries to write, she puts down random, senseless strings of words and letters. The target can communicate in crude gestures or by drawing, but not at a level of abstraction that allows true sign language or pictograms. The spell casts a notable burden on mages because it bars them from using High Speech or Atlantean runes.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Babel","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Banishers who follow the Abrahamic religions (including Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) frequently develop this spell. Devout Banishers recall the Tower of Babel: A story that bears more than a passing resemblance to legends about the fall of Atlantis."}]}
