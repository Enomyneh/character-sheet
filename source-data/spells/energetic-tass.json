Such tass might be a fire that burns without the need for fuel, or a pattern of shifting lights, crawling arcs of electricity or an otherworldly sound with no discernible source. Successes are allocated between Size and Potency. The Potency of the spell determines how complex the phenomenon created can be. Mana must be channeled into the tass, and can be withdrawn by a mage skilled in the Prime Arcanum, as normal (see the Create Tass spell). This energetic tass can inflict only bashing damage, and then only if in the form of electricity or fire. With Forces 4, and by adding an extra success to the spell's Potency, however, the tass can be made to inflict lethal damage when in such forms. Note that fire created by this spell does not automatically burn flammable items. Such fire must be made to inflict lethal damage, and the mage must will it to burn like a normal fire. The tass will then burn as normal for as long as the mage actively concentrates on making it do so.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
