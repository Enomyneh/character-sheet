Sometimes, however, an Arrow requires recourse to force greater than that which her armaments will normally allow. Sometimes, she needs to destroy creatures of flesh and bone (or other, less natural organisms) with rapidity and finality, and elegance be damned. After casting this spell on either her own body (with Life) or her weapon (with Matter), the Arrow may reflexively spend a point of Mana when making an attack to cause that single attack to inflict aggravated damage if successful, rather than bashing or lethal. Note that the willworker must spend this point of Mana before making the attack, and if the strike misses, the point of Mana is wasted. This spell in no way otherwise alters the attack made -- equipment bonuses remain the same, as do a weapon's other qualities, if any. This spell may only be used to augment a ranged attack if the actual instrument of harm is in direct contact with some part of the willworker's body immediately before being released (a throwing knife or arrow, for instance, but not a bullet).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Sword Of Ruin","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Strength","roteDicePool_Skill":"Intimidation","roteDescription":"Grim necessities give rise to terrible weapons.
