A closed mind causes more suspicion than an open mind that reveals only what you choose. With a single success on the casting roll, the mage may add a layer of conscious thought over her own. This layer contains information chosen by the mage during the casting. Repeated attempts to read a mind protected by this layer of false thoughts may reveal the shallowness of thinking. Suspicious mages may roll Resolve + Composure minus the Potency of the Still Waters casting, to confirm the mind they are attempting to read has been altered.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Disinformation","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"Members of the Adamantine Arrow use this spell to sow false information about their practices, tactics, and suspicions among their enemies.
