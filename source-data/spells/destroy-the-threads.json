Each success destroys one degree of sympathetic connection that a target holds for a single person, place, or thing, as per the sympathetic spells chart. For example, this spell can be cast upon a mage to erode the Intimate sympathetic connection he has to his best friend. It does not affect his mental or social feelings or interactions with his friend, but does make it harder for him to connect with that friend using sympathetic magic. A living creature unconsciously resists this spell's attempts to alter its connections with its Composure. These threads can be re-established normally over time in the usual fashion (i.e., through physical contact or even repeated mental and/or emotional association).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Shattering The Invisible Bonds","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Strength","roteDicePool_Skill":"Investigation","roteDescription":"As willworkers of the Arrow know, any kind of vulnerability can and eventually is exploited by an enemy. This rote drastically reduces the likelihood of an attack via sympathetic magic. Mages of the Mysterium, who are occasionally pursued by hostile willworkers (or even stranger beings) in the course of their work value similar magic (Resolve + Investigation + Space)."}]}
