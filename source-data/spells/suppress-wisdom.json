While this spell is in effect, the willworker can perform a single, specific act (declared during casting) that would be considered a transgression for a Wisdom rating of up to three dots lower than her current rating without checking for Wisdom degeneration. (In this case, a \"specific act\" must be just that: \"Killing the Acanthus, Oberon, with a spell,\" or even, \"Beating the leader of the Seers of the Throne pylon to within an inch of his life,\"; \"Committing murder,\" or, \"Hurting someone,\" on the other hand, is not a specific act.) Casting this spell more than once per chapter, though, whether upon oneself or another, is cause for immediate Wisdom degeneration, regardless of circumstances or the mage's current Wisdom. With Mind 5, this spell can be cast upon a willing subject, who must be either a Sleeper or another mage. (In the case of a Sleeper, the transgression specified must be a sin against Morality, rather than Wisdom.)","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Shroud Of Tears","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Resolve","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult (for casting on oneself) or Empathy (for another)","roteDescription":"Sometimes, a Guardian's work is accompanied by the flashing of long knives in the dark or the tormented screams of an unwilling subject.
