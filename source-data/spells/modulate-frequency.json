By means of this spell, willworkers can speak more freely, comfortable in the increased safety of their communications. By casting this spell on audio- and/or video-transmitting devices -- or without them, if all of the mages involved are capable of using magic to transmit and receive such signals -- a willworker can cause all transmissions to modulate frequency randomly but consistently. In other words: All transmitters, whether devices or spells, within the desired \"network\" modulate frequency at precisely the same rate, making it extremely difficult for an outsider to spy on the exchange.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Elusive Transmission","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Science","roteDescription":"In 1974, an Arrow calling himself Arclight developed this rote as a better means of coordinating between strike teams. Modern Arrows have taken his work and expanded upon it, enabling secure transmissions with cell phones, video equipment and words spoken into the wind by mages who can hijack radio waves for personal communication."}]}
