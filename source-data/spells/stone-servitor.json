{"name":"Stone Servitor","sourceBook":"Tome Of The Mysteries","sourcePage":"32","arcanaRequirement":"Mind 5 + Matter 4","primaryArcana":"Mind","requirements":[{"name":"Mind","dots":"5"},{"name":"Matter","dots":"4"}],"practice":"Making","action":"Extended","duration":"Prolonged (one scene)","aspect":"Vulgar","cost":"1 Mana","effect":"This spell creates a self-aware servant of animate stone from out of nearby substances, even the air itself. The servant's base Strength, Durability and Size are equal to the lesser of the mage's Matter or Gnosis. The servant possesses no Stamina rating, and has one dot in Dexterity, as well as all of the Mental and Social Attributes. Successes of Potency may be assigned to any of the factors above (excluding Stamina; for effects that test against such, substitute the servant's Durability) on a one-for-one basis. The construct cannot possess Skills or Merits. The servant weighs about 50 pounds at Size 1 and each dot of Size thereafter doubles the previous weight (100 pounds at size 2, 200 pounds at Size 3 and so on). Since the servant's consciousness dissipates at the end of the Duration of the spell, creating the servant without an inherent acceptance of the inevitability of its own end can easily constitute a sin against Wisdom. (This spell, however, may be re-cast before its Duration ends, enabling the Duration to be extended; this is an exception to normal spellcasting rules.) As stone, the construct can be modified by the Matter Arcanum in all the same ways as ordinary rock.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder","roteName":"Juggernaut","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Crafts","roteDescription":"Sometimes, you just can't entrust your safety to another human being, no matter how well-meaning or loyal.
