He could, for example, cause a wide-angle lantern beam to focus more tightly, like a flashlight beam, or split visible white light into its full spectrum of colors, like a prism. He could not (at this level) cause a weak light to become brighter or cause light to appear where it did not already exist. Successes determine the degree to which the light can be altered. For instance, with one success, a light beam can be diverted in a 90-degree direction, while two successes can turn it again by 90 degrees.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Brilliant Flow","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult or Science","roteDescription":"A Silver Ladder mage might use this rote to control the manner in which light falls around him, creating dramatic under-lighting or shining all the lamps in a room directly into the face of someone he interrogates."}]}
