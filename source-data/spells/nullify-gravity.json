A simple success decreases gravity within a five-cubic yard volume. Successes are allocated between the Potency of the gravity and the volume affected. Each point of Potency adds one to the Speed of anyone or anything within the area of effect. This sudden ease of motion might come as a surprise to a person affected. If more than five points are added to Speed, a reflexive Dexterity + Athletics roll is made for the subject to control her sudden vault. Also, every Potency point of the spell doubles a person's jumping distance per success. For example, under a spell with Potency 1, a character jumps two feet with a vertical leap and four feet with a standing broad jump. Flying creatures (including those using Forces spells to fly or to be lifted telekinetically) add one point to their flight Speeds when going straight upward.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium","roteName":"Moonwalking","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult or Science","roteDescription":"Great for a quick escape for an entire cabal, this Mysterium rote occasionally comes in handy in various other strange circumstances.
