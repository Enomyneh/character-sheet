The mage could, for example, make the small pile of ashes left behind by a person killed by fire look as though she died from a stab wound to the neck. In this fashion, mages have turned murder most foul into seeming accidents or the product of natural causes, or taken a perfectly innocent circumstance (quiet heart failure in the night or a tumble down a flight of stairs) and used it to frame someone for a killing she never committed. The mage can add or subtract one feature per success. A feature represents a single wound or disease condition, such as a laceration caused by a knife, burns caused by exposure to a conflagration, or a cancerous tumor in the target's liver.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Mortician's Touch","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"Even the most savvy coroner can be put off the trail of a blatantly paranormal death by means of this rote. Guardians thus preserve the integrity of the Mysteries. Adamantine Arrow mages, in the course of their work, must also sometimes occlude the truth behind a killing, so they too make use of this magic (Wits + Subterfuge + Death)."}]}
