He can exert control over most animal life, compelling such creatures to perform actions according to his desires so long as they are not completely inimical to such actions. This spell works the same as Beast Control, except that median minds can be commanded. The effect lasts until the tasks are completed or for one scene, whichever comes first.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"The Way Of Fang And Claw","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Animal Ken","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Resolve","roteDescription":"Human allies, whether Awakened or otherwise, can be reliable, but they are sometimes insufficient to a task. A rat can scamper between the walls of a house much more easily than any person, and rare indeed is the human being capable of eliciting the same sort of response from others as a full-grown charging grizzly bear. Mages of the Silver Ladder use the same magic to control the actions of both treasured pets and less valued animal servants."}]}
