By way of this spell, however, the contingent triggers with which many such objects are programmed can be temporarily altered, potentially making the invocation of an item's power difficult -- if not impossible -- for its possessor. This spell, if successfully cast, alters the contingent trigger of an Imbued Item that has one to a trigger of the caster's choice. This trigger may be extraordinarily difficult to accomplish (\"When sprinkled with lunar soil,\") or very easy (\"When grasped in hand,\", but the item's powers cannot be rendered either completely inaccessible or continual. If the item is currently in the possession of an individual unwilling to have its trigger altered, then the spell becomes contested, with the possessor rolling Resolve + Gnosis in opposition to the caster.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Seers Of The Throne Rote","roteName":"Exchange The Secret Key","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"While it is true that every advantage counts in a conflict, so too does every enemy advantage that a willworker can counter.
