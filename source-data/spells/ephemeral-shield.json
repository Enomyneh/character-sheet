The mage gains one point of armor per dot he possesses in the Spirit Arcanum. By spending one Mana, the Duration can be made to last for one day. Most mages cast such a shielding spell at the beginning of the day, as part of their morning rituals. Successes are used to combat attempts to dispel the shield. Note that this magical armor does not apply against an opponent's attempts to achieve a grappling hold on the mage (the Fate, Mind, Space, and Time Arcana provide shielding spells to do that). Nor does it apply against a grappling opponent's attempts to overpower the mage. It does, however, protect against attempts to inflict damage upon him (subtract the armor points from any overpower roll that intends to damage the mage or attack him with a drawn weapon).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Adamantine Arrow Rote","roteName":"Ghost Shirt","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Stamina","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Not all threats come from this world. Arrow mages use this rote to armor themselves against physical attacks from beings native to the Shadow Realm. Guardians of the Veil, who also have occasion to meet with spirits under less-than-friendly circumstances, use their own magic (Resolve + Occult + Spirit) to achieve the same effect."}]}
