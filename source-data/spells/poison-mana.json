Once used, the poisoned Mana injures whoever's channeling it. The spell taints a number of points of Mana equal to the spell's Potency. The spell can be cast on a Hallow, where it affects the first Mana drawn until its Potency in points has been withdrawn. Once a mage internalizes the Mana, the poisoned Mana stays inert until it's transferred to another receptacle, expended on a spell or used on another action. When that happens, the Mana performs its normal functions, but each point spent also inflicts a point of lethal damage. A Prime 5 version of this spell can be used to poison Mana to such an extent that it inflicts aggravated damage.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"The Wages Of Sin","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Presence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","roteDescription":"Famous \"cult awareness researcher\" Isaiah Pickens conducts regular sermons at places he says are hotbeds of cult activity. He does the same thing for fellow Banishers when they bring him objects that stink of excess Mana. The theme of every sermon is that Satan has no real power and his promises and payments are always empty. He says, \"That rush you feel, exploring witchcraft and playing with the dark side can never profit you -- Satan has nothing to give! Even when he looks like he's giving you the power he has to take something away to keep the balance of his gifts -- a balance of zero. Those are the wages of sin, my friends.\" And, for mages who draw from Hallows and items he's preached around, that turns out to be true."}]}
