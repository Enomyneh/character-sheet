The idea to be implanted must be relatively simple, something that could be summed up in a single sentence. Examples might include \"The map I'm looking for could be behind the bookcase\" or \"There's probably an alarm on that door, so I'd better not open it.\" The target is not compelled to act on the inspiration in any particular way, but will react to it as he'd react to any idea: probably follow it (if it's reasonable), possibly try it (if it could be a lucky hunch) or dismiss it (if it's wildly inappropriate). Targets with Mind 1 or greater are allowed a reflexive Wits + Composure roll to sense the intrusion of an outside thought.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"The Unspoken Hint","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Manipulation","roteDicePool_Skill":"Expression","RoteDicePool_Contested":"Resolve + Gnosis","roteDescription":"Someone likely to reject unsolicited advice may follow the same course of action if he thinks it's his own idea. By choosing the proper suggestion and delivering it at the right moment, it's possible for a Guardian steer the target in a desired direction, while the target thinks he's acting of his own free will (because he is). The better the mage knows his target, the more effective his message becomes: someone who's afraid of dogs, for example, could be powerfully affected by the thought that there might be dogs nearby."}]}
