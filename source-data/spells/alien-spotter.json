If an entity of any kind, extraterrestrial or otherwise, attempts to hide, it may use whatever method the entity possesses and pit its successes against those of the Banisher. More successes mean that the entity remains hidden and the Banisher's attempt fails.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Banisher","roteName":"Invader Or Parasite","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Empathy","roteDescription":"This rote enables the Banisher to determine whether or not an alien is masquerading as a human or is possessing a human who might be salvaged. So far, the Translators have not yet determined how to separate a possessing alien, though they are looking into the practice of exorcism as a model."}]}
