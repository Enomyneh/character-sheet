This can be the perfect camouflage or the perfect information-gathering tool. If the mage has Fate 5, he may cast this spell on another person as well (unwilling targets resist reflexively with Resolve). Any supernatural effect intended to pierce the veil of this spell must achieve successes equal to the spell's Potency. An exceptional success on a spell or power that reads auras reveals that your aura is completely static, which may signal something amiss, but does not necessarily pierce the deception. If the Duration of the Scribe Final Name spell that carries the assumed Final Name expires, this spell's effects end immediately. Assuming another person's Final Name confers the following benefits: (A) Your Virtue and Vice appear to be those of the owner of the Final Name (these traits do not actually change, but they appear different to supernatural observation). (B) Your aura appears fixed as the owner's aura at the instant the original Scribe Final Name spell was cast. (C) Your resonance appears to be that of the Final Name. (D) You automatically gain any sympathetic connections the Final Name carries with it, at no penalty. (The penalty for not knowing a subject's name applies, however -- including a penalty if you don't know the mundane name attached to the Final Name you assumed.)<BR>","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
