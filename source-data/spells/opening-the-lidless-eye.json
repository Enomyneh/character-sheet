They spoke for half an hour, and when it was time for Mrs Besant to leave, the older woman fixed Mrs Besant's gaze and said only this: \"Oh my dear Mrs Besant, if only you would come among us.\" At that moment, Mrs Besant's perceptions were altered. This was the moment of her conversion. By talking to the subject about anything at all, the mage can implant a tiny suggestion. A single trigger phrase, right at the end of the conversation, instantly expands the subject's perceptions. Suddenly, everything looks new and strange."}]}
