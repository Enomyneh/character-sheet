He does not really turn night into day, but does create a miniature sun, a source of true sunlight. The spell's successes determine the area of direct sunlight; anything outside the area might be illuminated indirectly by the glow, but isn't otherwise affected. Needless to say, this spell is especially deadly to vampires. Within the radius affected, the sunlight is \"direct\" (three points of aggravated damage per turn). Outside the immediate radius (within double the radius' area), the sunlight is \"faint\" (one point of aggravated damage per turn).","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
