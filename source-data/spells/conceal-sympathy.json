Each success allows the mage to decrease the apparent sympathetic connection he has to a single person, place, or thing. He might have an Intimate connection to a cabal-mate, but with three successes, he can make that connection appear (to the eyes of anyone who can see it, such as with the \"Correspondence\" spell) to be merely an Encountered connection. The true connection is unaffected; it only appears to be more distant.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Dispersing The Threads","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Composure","roteDicePool_Skill":"Subterfuge","roteDescription":"A Guardian who fears that enemies will try to strike at her through friends and loved ones can baffle them by making it appear that connections are more aloof than they truly are."}]}
