She can detect the presence of temporal phenomena, such as the subtle distortions clinging to a person suffering from \"lost time\" or those surrounding advanced uses of this Arcanum. During this spell's Duration, a reflexive Wits + Investigation roll can be made for the mage to detect a temporal disturbance that occurs within his sensory range. She can also examine such phenomena.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Guardians Of The Veil Rote","roteName":"Espying The Graven Hour","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"With this rote, Guardians of the Veil are able to discern Time magics (or similar powers) that have been used to somehow alter the natural flow of past, present, and future. Some describe such phenomena as being \"etched\" or \"engraved\" on the progression of Time. Mages of the Adamantine Arrow prefer not to be surprised by other uses of the Arcanum (such as prepared spells), so use this rote as a matter of security."}]}
