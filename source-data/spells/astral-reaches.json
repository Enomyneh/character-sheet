The mage can use spells that short-circuit distance, such as Apportation and Portal, to travel between any portions of Astral Space. Invoking this spell enables the mage to use this power for any relevant spells he casts during the Duration. At Space 5, the mage can also pierce from Astral Space to real space and the reverse, allowing a mage to skip the astral journey. He must still spend a point of Mana to cross the Astral Threshold.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Mysterium Rote","roteName":"Puncturing The Worldskin","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Intelligence","roteDicePool_Skill":"Occult","roteDescription":"Enlightening as it may be, the journey into Astral Space is time-consuming and distracting.
