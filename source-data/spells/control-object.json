In effect, the mage talks to a device and asks it to work. With a successful roll, the mage convinces the spirit of the device to act in the manner he desires. He could cause a gun someone else was holding to fire or put its safety on. Similarly, the character could cause a car to start and drive forward or swerve suddenly left simply by speaking to it. The mage can even cause a lock to open or an alarm system to turn off. However, he can affect only a device he can clearly see and is within comfortable speaking range of. If the alarm system on a door is controlled by a distant mechanism, the willworker cannot affect it. Also, while the mage could type commands into a keyboard merely by asking the keyboard to type his request, he could not discover a computer password or gain access to files he does not already know how to access. In addition, devices cannot be made to perform actions that are not part of their normal function. They cannot break or disable themselves unless that is a normal part of their use (such as a fire alarm that is set off by breaking glass) and while the character can cause a gun to fire, unless the gun is something like a boat's deck gun in a swivel mount, the character cannot cause it to aim itself. However, a character can often disable a device by asking a visible screw or similar part to unscrew itself.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"Silver Ladder Rote","roteName":"Commanding The Inanimate","roteDicePool_Attribute":"Wits","roteDicePool_Skill":"Persuasion","roteDescription":"In addition to commanding other mages, members of the Silver Ladder also often learn to command various facets of the natural world.
