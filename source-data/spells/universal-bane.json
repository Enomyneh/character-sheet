After a near-death experience, he was trapped in a bardo or psychic \"gap,\" constantly confronting the Wrathful Deities that monks told him about when he was young. For years now, those same monks came to him, sharing their alms in exchange for his insights about spiritual realms. Every night, Dorjee screamed in his dreams, but every dream taught him something new. So when the demon came disguised as a newly arrived monk Dorjee knew what to do. He stole a vajra -- a knife that represented the \"thunderbolt\" of enlightenment -- and stabbed the monster, calling on the absolute reality of the dharmakaya to dismiss its incarnation."}]}
