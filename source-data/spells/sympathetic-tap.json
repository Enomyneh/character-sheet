This spell allows the mage to watch the connection of a target for those moments it becomes active. The spell watches a sympathetic connection (usually targeted after the use of Interconnections or similar spells) for \"activity\", defined as the target being in the presence of, thinking about or otherwise acting on the relationship defined by the connection. The strength of the sympathetic connection being targeted determines the number of successes required. On successful casting, the mage becomes aware when any activity occurs but does not know exactly what is occurring -- for that; they must cast Scrying. This spell is detectable by anyone using Spatial Awareness on the target.","rotes":[{"roteOrder":"","roteName":"","roteDicePool_Attribute":"","roteDicePool_Skill":"","roteDescription":""}]}
