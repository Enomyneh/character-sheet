    "description": "Researching information is a fairly straightforward task that involves querying libraries and databases. Roll Intelligence + Academics + equipment. The number of successes required depends on the complexity and/or obscurity of the desired information. A simple set of facts might demand three successes to obtain, while a littleknown or difficult-to-find reference might demand 10 or more successes to uncover. Depending on the quality of the libraries or databases available, the Storyteller may grant a +1 or higher modifier to task rolls.",
