Is it the capacity to Awaken? Such a view is arrogant in the extreme, say the Sphinxes, for to look at the Sleepers as inferior is to ignore one’s own humanity. No, to the mages who choose to follow this Legacy, the true magic of humanity is language. More to the point, it is the capacity for symbolic recognition, to see a gesture or a marking, hear a collection of sounds, and from that understand. Human beings are optimized, either by the design of a greater being or the rigors of evolution, toward speech and language, both anatomically and neurologically. But all of the biophysical adaptations of the human body toward speech mean nothing without the ability to understand symbols. Upon this phenomenon (some would say “miracle”), the Legacy of the Sphinx is based. Walking the path of the Sphinx is an exercise in abstraction, for the Legacy teaches understanding without processing, learning truth without realizing fact. A Sphinx sees meaning everywhere — in the number of cracks in a sidewalk, in the seemingly random sounds from a baby’s babbling, in the texture of a brick wall. Intrinsic in this ability to find meaning anywhere is the knowledge that this meaning comes from somewhere. Sphinxes who cleave to the Atlantean model of mystical understanding posit that this meaning might come from ancient masters sending information forward in time, in a much more subtle way than with the ananke (see p. 330 of Mage: The Awakening). Those who do not follow the orders of the Pentacle — and even some who do — believe that this truth comes directly from the Supernal Realms. The name “Sphinx,” of course, comes from the mythological creature that Oedipus confronted near Thebes. He solved the riddle of the Sphinx, and she leaped to her death in horror that her secret was revealed. Whether the name “Sphinx” was one that members of this Legacy originally applied to themselves or not, they do not see themselves as jealous keepers of secrets. Indeed, they tend to view themselves as searchers trying to solve a riddle. That riddle is difficult to express, because it is so vast in scope, but the basic idea is this: If meaning can be found in anything, at any level of understanding or consciousness, then what is the ultimate meaning? Where does the truth come from, and to what purpose?"},{"title":"Orders","text":"While any Mastigos can become a Sphinx, the Legacy’s membership is primarily drawn from the Mysterium. The order’s predilection for finding, analyzing and cataloguing knowledge, combined with the fact that the Mysterium often encounters information too dangerous to be read and understood by an untrained mage, points members of all Paths toward the Legacy. Outside of the Mysterium, the order that claims the largest number of Pathfinders is unquestionably the Guardians of the Veil. Sphinxes are by nature superlative ciphers, capable of breaking almost any code or circumventing any puzzle, given enough time. The Guardians thus appreciate their ability to weave symbols and hidden messages, both true and misleading, into the secret societies and fronts that the order sets up. In fact, it isn’t uncommon for an Epopt to be a Sphinx herself or at least work with one. It’s easy for even the Guardians themselves to become lost in the morass of conflicting symbolism and double-blind codes, and a Sphinx makes a good “skeleton key” when quick understanding and interpretation are necessary. Warlocks of other orders do find their way to the Legacy as well, of course. Sphinxes of the Adamantine Arrow tend to use their ability to find meaning and truth in the mundane as a way to avoid danger and protect those around them. Pathfinders in the Free Council stay on the cutting edge of linguistic theory and language development, searching for ways to expand people’s understanding of each other and themselves. The Silver Ladder’s few Sphinxes often believe that the Ladder is the best way to recreate some of the conditions in lost Atlantis, and thus come closer to the secrets and messages that the ancients held."},{"title":"Appearance","text":"Sphinxes might come from any walk of life. The Legacy is not culturally based, and so doesn’t dictate a lifestyle or a given mode of dress. Most Sphinxes are contemplative and observant, and many are easily distracted, staring for long minutes at patterns of texture or light as they try to interpret them. Pathfinders also tend to be good listeners and remain open to communication with others. Thus, Pathfinders go out of their way to appear non-threatening and available."},{"title":"Background","text":"Prospective Sphinxes are often linguists, or at least interested in language and symbolism. Some are computer programmers working with code; others are teachers or speech pathologists attempting to help others communicate. Some don’t come from a background relating to communication at all, but feel that the universe has a greater meaning that needs to be deciphered. Mastigos who choose this Legacy are often struck by the cacophony of Pandemonium during their Awakenings, and wish to interpret the ranting and screaming of the demons found there."},{"title":"Organization","text":"Sphinxes of the Mysterium have a worldwide system of coded messages spread throughout a variety of media. Small radio stations, public access television shows, magazine articles, books and, of course, Internet sites, all serve as bulletin boards for the Legacy. The messages are all heavily coded and require time and effort to encode or decode, but the wealth of knowledge that a Sphinx of the order can draw upon is great. Outside the order, Pathfinders have little in the way of formal contact, though when they encounter each other the meeting is usually friendly. The relationship between mentor and student varies. Since the training requires so much intuition and comparatively little actual study, some students come to resent their mentors, feeling that they are deliberately keeping secrets and knowledge from the students. Others (typically those who go on to become successful as Sphinxes) recognize that the philosophy and wisdom of the Legacy is extremely difficult to teach, and respect their mentors all the more because of it."},{"title":"The Mysterium Network","text":"Any Sphinx, Mysterium or otherwise, can take advantage of the network of information created by the order’s Pathfinders. Doing so requires purchasing the Contacts Merit (Mysterium Network). The information that can be gained via the network is vast and usually accurate, but requires use of the Hidden Meaning Attainment (see p. 96) to ask a question and decode the answer. As such, the network is almost useless for time-sensitive queries (most questions get answered in less than a month, at least)."},{"title":"Suggested Oblations","text":"Solving a puzzle (crosswo r d , S u d o k u , even certain video games).

The greatest secrets of the Supernal Realms were fractured, shards of power and knowledge spread out among the mages of the world. Without the Island of the Magi’s society to compile the knowledge, the Awakened had to work alone or in small cabals, never knowing enough of the truth to recapture their past glories. The Sphinx Legacy arose from the frustration of those mages. The Mastigos of the time knew that with the application of the Mind Arcanum they could comprehend any earthly language, but that wasn’t enough. Language wasn’t the true barrier, these mages discovered, because a language is merely a set of symbols. These primordial Sphinxes realized that inherent in the process of making symbols lay the solution to the confusion caused by the destruction of the Celestial Ladder — that they could look beyond graphemes and sounds and simply communicate with pure meaning. Modern-day Sphinxes sometimes claim that the Legacy was an important part of the formation of the Mysterium, and that might well be true. Whether or not this was the case, the Sphinx Legacy became, over time, the province of the Wings of the Dragon almost exclusively. While a lone Mastigos might occasionally discover and follow the Legacy, the order guarded its secrets jealously. Something as basic to humanity as the quest for communication and language, however, wasn’t going to remain under lock and key forever."},{"title":"The De Velasco Resurgence","text":"The first reliably recorded instance of a mage outside the Mysterium joining the Legacy came in 1575 or so, in a book written by a Spanish nobleman (and Mastigos) named Juan de Velasco. De Velasco had observed his two young cousins, who were both born deaf, being tutored by a Benedictine monk named Pedro Ponce de Léon. Classical opinions on the deaf stated that they had very little education potential and that they could never learn to speak (if deafness occurred pre-lingually). Ponce de Léon, himself a Sleeper, challenged that opinion, and taught the de Velasco brothers not only to read and write, but to speak three different languages. He did not, however, record his methods, and so history would have to wait for widespread methods of educating the deaf, but Juan de Velasco watched his cousins’ lessons with interest. He was less interested in teaching deaf people than in the conveyance of meaning in non-verbal ways. He wrote several treatises on the topic for his Consilium, the most famous of which was titled “The Art and Science of the Recognition of Meaning.” In that document, he detailed how he was able to send coded messages through paintings and divine the immediate future by listening to hymns at Mass (as later mages have pointed out, de Velasco probably wasn’t reading the future per se; rather, he was reading probability). De Velasco’s writings have been translated into many different languages over the years, although modern Sphinxes have found that reading them in their original Latin yields layers of meaning far beyond the simple message of the words. The Mysterium currently holds most of these documents, but de Velasco was a prolific writer and painter, and historians the world over might unknowingly hold either one of his esoteric writings or hauntingly beautiful paintings. Either type of work might actually be a road map to a rote, an Atlantean temple or some other worthy goal. De Velasco left no record behind of a pupil, but it is widely accepted that de Velasco passed his learning along to another Mastigos. Whether this pupil was a member of the Mysterium or not is a debated issue; the order claims that he was, while members of all of the other orders also claim him (and often have records that seem to support their claims). The Mysterium has history on its side, of course, but after de Velasco the Legacy became available to any mage of the order who wished to become a Pathfinder. Since then, the Mysterium has tried to project the image that they created the Legacy in the first place. Even so, the Legacy remains the province of the Warlocks just as much as that of the Alae Draconis. Other than de Velasco, history has not produced famous Sphinxes. The Pathfinders tend to be inscrutable and unobtrusive, even by Awakened standards, and, of course, any mage who achieved mastery of the Legacy’s Attainments would be exceptionally difficult to find in any record (see the Off the Path Attainment, below). The Mysterium, true to form, tries to keep records of the members of the order who have gone on to become Pathfinders, but the Sphinxes themselves often alter such records, leaving behind only obtuse riddles that, properly interpreted, might lead to the mage in question."},{"title":"Society and Culture","text":"Because so much of the Sphinx mindset and activity relies on observation rather than direct action, mages outside of the Mysterium don’t often know much about the Legacy. What they do know tends to depend on who they hear it from or the particular Sphinx they’ve encountered. Some Sphinxes are infuriatingly cryptic, either because they genuinely enjoy lording their uncanny insight over others or because they are inundated with so much information that they fear to reveal too much or too little. Other Sphinxes are happy to share what they know, but are well aware that their information tends to be true, but lacking in context. Consider: A Sphinx can read a thick book in an ancient language in an hour and understand all of the information it contains, but he will be hard-pressed to convey the nuances and intricacies of the information. His rendition of the information resembles a quick summary, and this leaves listeners to wonder about its accuracy. Indeed, it’s not uncommon for non-Sphinxes to assume that a Pathfinder is using some kind of fortune-telling method to glean the information, and such methods (often based on Time or Space magic) aren’t often completely accurate. The Sphinxes protest this, saying that their methods rely on direct observation rather than symbolic guesswork, but because those methods are based largely on intuition that non-Sphinxes do not possess these protests often go unheard. In the end, many Pathfinders find it easiest not to advertise their membership in the Legacy and to offer help and advice only when it is requested. Of course, that sometimes results in other mages labeling them reclusive and unhelpful, but an experienced Pathfinder has long since given up on pleasing all the people all the time. The culture of the Sphinx Legacy is one of research, academia and intuition. Sphinxes aren’t necessarily impulsive, but they do tend to be easily distracted, and mentors of the Legacy encourage Pathfinders to follow clues that they see in the hidden patterns of the world. This leads Sphinxes to cross paths with cabals of mages and even stranger inhabitants of the World of Darkness, and so members of the Legacy tend to be skilled at either diplomacy or flight (or, more rarely, defensive combat). Among the Awakened, Sphinxes try to become well-versed in which cabal holds influence in what area and who the local movers and shakers of the Consilium are, just in case the Sphinxes need to name-drop to justify trespassing. Their skill in dealing with people grants them a great deal of latitude in such situations, and so Sphinxes often occupy positions in a Consilium such as Herald or Councilor. In the Mysterium, the Sphinx takes up the role of guardian, much like his namesake. Sphinxes don’t ask riddles of seekers, but they also don’t give information out to just anyone. This isn’t due to a perception that others aren’t worthy of the knowledge (usually), but rather that the knowledge in question might be dangerous. Sphinxes can absorb information without attracting its attention, learning by observation of patterns rather than direct reading and study. As such, a Sphinx might administer a coded test to a mage seeking a book or fact that the Sphinx considers risky. If the mage has the patience and skill to decipher it, the Sphinx considers it safe to grant the mage what he seeks. This role, of course, is the very definition of a thankless task, since it brands the Sphinx as a stingy distributor of knowledge. Even so, it is a role for which the Pathfinders are uniquely suited, and so members of the Legacy who belong to the Mysterium often become Censors. The Legacy’s overarching philosophy — that the universe has meaning and that this meaning was put in place deliberately — doesn’t actually see much discussion among Sphinxes unless one of them has made a breakthrough. New members of the Legacy often hear the theory on the matter that their tutors espouse, and pick up more as they interact with other Pathfinders. Most Sphinxes have preconceived notions about the nature of the meaning of the universe. Popular hypotheses include the following: • God: Regardless what religion or faith the Sphinx espouses, the notion of a Divine creator (or at least organizer) is almost as popular among mages as among Sleepers. The fact that no explanation of Atlantis, the Fall, the Celestial Ladder or the Supernal Realms actually contradicts this belief is helpful. Theist Sphinxes believe that the messages they see in everyday patterns are God’s communication with Earth, and that the language of pure meaning is the true divine language. • Oracles: Sphinxes with a more magic-centered view of the world believe that the Oracles, the secret masters trapped in the Supernal Realms during the collapse of the Celestial Ladder, manipulate events and patterns so subtly that these machinations are virtually unnoticeable unless one is specifically looking. These Sphinxes claim that, with rare exceptions (such as the ananke), the Oracles cannot communicate directly, as the Abyss thwarts them. Only by nudging the world in imperceptible ways — causing a flock of birds to take flight at the right second, a gust of wind that alters the direction of raindrops, and so on — can they send their messages. Of course, if the Oracles can do this, the Sphinxes sometimes wonder, what stops the Exarchs from doing so as well? The answer is: nothing, and the Seers of the Throne boast their share of Pathfinders. • The Supernal Realms: Although the Sphinx Legacy belongs as much to the Warlocks as to the Mysterium, comparatively few Mastigos espouse this particular theory to explain the origin of the messages in the world. Those who do are quite different from the usual contemplative and observant Pathfinders — such Mastigos tend to be fearful and paranoid. Some Sphinxes believe that the denizens of the Supernal Realms are responsible for the informative patterns that the Sphinxes so diligently analyze. These denizens might not even be creating these patterns deliberately, the mages say, but the Fallen World reflects the Supernal Realms. Therefore, the true nature of reality comes through in everything the world has to offer, regardless of whether Sleepers (or even most of the Awakened) are prepared to look for it. Of course, the implications of the inhabitants of Pandemonium leaving hints for mages to find are troubling, to say the least. This, perhaps, is why this theory has more adherents among Mysterium Sphinxes of other Paths. The notion that the patterns are the inhuman whispers of demons is profoundly disquieting. No matter which Supernal Realm the patterns originate from, though (and it would make more sense to assume that allof them have some input), their natives are inscrutable and largely unknowable by human standards, yet certainly not all-powerful. Is there a greater design above even the mysterious clues left in random patterns of wind, ink and brick?"},{"title":"Induction","text":"Prospective Sphinxes often begin their training for the Legacy before they know it exists. Inquisitive and persistent, they pay close attention to the world around them, searching for an overlying meaning. Chaos theory, fractal theory and even the “theory” of intelligent design have produced students of the right mindset to become Pathfinders. If a mage looks deeply enough into the right patterns, using the right methods, he might receive a flash of insight that allows him to break a message coded with the Hidden Meaning Attainment. Alternately, his studies might just lead him to a mage already known for the same kind of research. In any case, sooner or later the prospective Sphinx finds a Sphinx. Presuming that the Sphinx that the prospective member finds is willing and able to take on a pupil, and that the chemistry between the two mages is of the right sort to permit such a relationship, the tutor typically inundates the student with coded messages. At first, the mage simply uses mundane codes, starting with simple alphabetical ciphers and moving up to complex encryption. The mage doesn’t need to learn how to break all of these codes, and certainly isn’t forbidden from using magic in his attempt. The important lesson here is to look beyond letters, numbers and words and see meaning in markings, sounds and patterns. This kind of approach isn’t easy to teach, as it relies more on intuition than process, and some mages simply aren’t up to the task. The tutor watches carefully to see if his student is capable of learning what the tutor is presenting, of seeing a meaning greater than the message. If so, they can begin the process of soulcrafting. If not, the tutor gently (or not-so-gently, depending on the mage in question) suggests that the student might find what he seeks elsewhere. In the Mysterium, the process works a little differently. Mages who show a predilection for puzzles, ciphers and language are often told about the Legacy in a roundabout fashion (so as to avoid making it seem as though membership in a Legacy is being offered or suggested). A mage who is a good candidate for becoming a Pathfinder will pursue information about the Legacy, or so goes the theory. Once word gets out in a given Consilium’s Mysterium cabal(s) that a mage wants to join the Legacy, the network becomes activated and the mage’s accomplishments, history, faults and foibles are made known to any Sphinx who bothers to check. If the mage is a good fit for the Legacy, a tutor arranges to travel to the student or have the student brought to him for training. In either case, the stages of soulcrafting don’t require much in the way of ceremony. Once a mage has reached the required level of power, his tutor assists him in delving deeper into the mysteries of the world’s wisdom. This is normally accompanied by several days of study, questioning and observation of whatever phenomena the mentor feels hold the wisdom the student needs in order to progress. Some tutors hole their students up in libraries preceding a new Attainment, others immerse their charges in as much sensation as possible in order to force the student to focus on one pattern at a time. Tutors, whatever their methods, watch their students for signs of madness at all times. When everything around a mage is significant, when nothingis coincidence or meaningless, he can feel paralyzed and helpless, afraid to do anything for fear of offsetting some cosmic balance. Alternately, some Sphinxes become drunk with the power and knowledge they possess, striving to learn as much as they can to exert maximum possible influence in the world. Either of these eventualities is cause for alarm to the tutor, because they distract the student from his quest to learn the origin of meaning. A Sphinx who degenerates too much or too quickly in Wisdom might find himself placed in an oubliette, magically deprived of any sensation whatsoever. It is believed that, in this kind of environment with no patterns from which to derive information, that a mad Sphinx can find himself again and regain his sanity. This doesn’t always work, of course; sometimes the madness just intensifies, but the oubliette is the best the Legacy can do to help. The alternative is to remove the mage’s ability to see the world’s meaning permanently, and the only way to do that is to kill him."},{"title":"","text":""}],"attainmentDescription":"The Attainments of the Sphinx are, for the most part, perceptive in nature rather than proactive. To the Pathfinders, the important and most difficult part of problem-solving is gaining the knowledge required to solve it. Alexander’s brutish solution to the Gordian Knot repulses them, because it sends the message that brute force can replace patience and understanding. Destructive magic can be countered, manipulative magic can be redirected, but magic that hides knowledge cannot stop a persistent and intelligent willworker.","attainments":[{"order":1,"name":"Hidden Meaning","prerequisites":["Gnosis 3","Fate 2","Investigation 2"],"description":"The Sphinx’s first Attainment allows her to find and decipher wisdom in the mundane. Anything that has a pattern can be used for this purpose, be it cracks in the ceiling or the calls of a flock of birds. The mage merely needs to study the pattern for a few seconds to gain the information contained therein. The effect is similar to the Fate 1 “Interconnections” spell (see p. 148 of Mage: The Awakening), except that the Attainment requires only an instant action and bestows information as though the mage had achieved five successes on the roll. Sphinxes, therefore, are awash in information if they stop to consider it, able to see connections, however faint, between any objects, people or places in sight. In addition to see these sympathetic connections, a Sphinx can use this Attainment to solve puzzles and riddles, since she can see the patterns behind their creation. Sphinx characters with this Attainment receive a +3 modifier to all Mental rolls involving riddles, puzzles, mazes or other such conundrums. A more common use of this Attainment, however, is its ability to hide meaning within seemingly random patterns. A Sphinx can use Hidden Meaning to write (or draw or record) a message in a code that no Sleeper cipher can crack. The mage must physically create the message, either by writing a seemingly innocuous letter, drawing a picture or any other method she prefers. The player rolls Manipulation + Investigation or Academics to encrypt the message. When another mage with this Attainment tries to decipher the code, her player must make an extended Intelligence + Investigation roll to do so, with a number of required successes equal to [5 x the successes on the encryption roll]. Again, each roll requires an hour of deciphering. The encoding mage may choose to forego her roll, meaning that any Sphinx can decode the message automatically. A mage with Fate 2 can also attempt to uncover the meaning in the message. First she must be aware that the underlying meaning exists, which is by itself difficult (she might be tipped off by an ally, a hunch or even the Dream Merit). She then casts an improvised and extended Fate 2 spell, with a number of required successes equal to [5 x encoder’s successes, minimum of five]. Optional Arcanum: Mind 2 A Sphinx who has studied the Arcanum of Mind can use her knowledge of the patterns and intrinsic meaning to aid her in interactions with others. By studying a person’s movements, the subtle messages conveyed by facial expression, body language and breathing and even how others react to him, the Sphinx gains an advantage in dealing with him. This effect is similar to the Mind 2 “First Impressions” spell (see p. 208 of Mage: The Awakening). The Sphinx may add her dots in Mind as a dice bonus to the first roll made with a given target. Many Pathfinders discover that the first Attainment of the Legacy is all that they require. Indeed, much of the Legacy’s reputation is based upon the knowledge and insight conveyed in Hidden Meaning — the ability to solve puzzles and escape labyrinths, to see meaning in the mundane. Sphinxes who continue on use this Attainment as a basis upon which later, more powerful magic rests. Those who pursue other agendas, however, use Hidden Meaning to send messages to double agents in other factions (or even orders), to share research with colleagues around the world, right under the noses of their enemies, and to help Sleepers and even other mages solve puzzles that no methods the Fallen World has produced can fathom. Sphinxes who make frequent use of this Attainment to encrypt messages often develop a preferred format for those messages. One Sphinx might design websites dedicated to some inane fandom, while another writes poetry reproduced only in small-circulation periodicals. As long as the message reaches its intended viewer, the Sphinx doesn’t often care how the vehicle for the message is regarded. Sometimes, though, a Sphinx creates a vehicle for a message that has resonance and value in its own right. When this happens, the message might gain fame and widespread circulation, inadvertently passing the message along to any mage who knows how to look for it. Some such messages are even rumored to trigger Awakenings, as Sleepers on the verge of enlightenment see the Supernal Realms lurking in an otherwise mundane painting or song."},{"order":2,"name":"Truth Without Knowledge","prerequisites":["Gnosis 5","Fate 3","Investigation 3"],"description":"Knowing the truth of the world by interpreting its many hidden messages is only the first step toward the superlative understanding that the Sphinx hopes one day to reach. Along that way, however, she learns to take advantage of the clues that surround her as to the fundamental nature of reality. To the untrained eye, she looks lucky or simply confident, but to a mage, every action she takes is fraught with significance. The second Attainment that a Sphinx can achieve allows her to mimic the effects of the Fate 2 “Exceptional Luck” spell (see p. 151 of Mage: The Awakening). No roll or Mana expenditure is required. The mage simply takes an instant action to study the patterns of meaning around her, in the same way as described for the Hidden Meaning Attainment. The player may then designate a number of rolls equal to the character’s Gnosis rating during the same scene to have the 9 again quality. Pathfinders also find that the more they rely on this Attainment, the more resonant their actions become. Mage Sight cast through the Fate Arcanum can easily detect them. Mages attempting to use Fate spells such as “Interconnections” or “The Sybil’s Sight” receive a +1 dice bonus during any scene in which Sphinx has used this Attainment to gain the 9 again quality. This bonus can cancel penalties levied by the Occultation Merit and spells such as Fate 3 “Fabricate Fortune.” Optional Arcanum: Mind 3 By listening to patterns of sound in speech (or watching patterns of letters in written discourse), the mage can understand anything she hears or reads. This mimics the Mind 3 “Universal Language” spell, save that the mage can only understand rather than express with this Attainment. Also, she can perform research and learning-related extended Mental tasks in half the time they would normally take (that is, if every roll in an extended task would normally take an hour, this time is reduced to 30 minutes). The second Attainment of the Sphinx Legacy opens the mage further to the truth of the world and the hidden messages it contains, but still does not address the question of who or what might be sending these messages. Pathfinders at this stage make superb interpreters, translators and researchers (which is one reason the Mysterium teaches this Legacy). More martial Sphinxes enjoy the tactical benefits of this Attainment, but are careful when using it in conflict with other Awakened, as the Sphinxes are wary of coming to the notice of powerful mages by weaving themselves too tightly into the universe’s inner workings. Indeed, the Sphinxes tell stories of members of the Legacy who have become unable to see the world as anything other than an abstract mess of implication and possibility — unable to perceive light or sound anymore, they function solely through the information this Attainment grants."},{"order":3,"name":"Off the Path","prerequisites":["Gnosis 7","Fate 4"],"description":"The mage learns to “walk between” the paths of meaning in the world, disappearing from the cycles of destiny. As far as the world and its many layers of hidden messages are concerned, the Sphinx no longer exists (for as long as this Attainment is active). The Sphinx spends a moment in silent meditation, perceiving the threads of fate and stepping between them (this requires three turns of contemplation). After this, the mage’s destiny can remain “invisible” in this manner for as long as she wishes, but during this time she cannot use the Truth Without Knowledge Attainment to gain the 9 again quality, or cast any spell altering another person’s destiny (this include spells dealing with oaths, such as “Alter Oath,” as well as spells such as “Occlude Destiny” or “Destroy Bindings”). While the Attainment is active, however, she is immune to all spells that would perceive, alter, improve or denigrate her fate (including the spells just mentioned). All sympathetic magic targeted against her is considered to be four steps further removed. (So, to even attempt targeting her with a sympathetic spell, the caster would need an Intimate connection, which would then suffer a –10 penalty as though it were Described.) Also, the Sphinx is extremely difficult to scrutinize magically. She is considered to have the Occultation Merit at a rating equal to her dots in the Fate Arcanum. This Attainment does not make the character physically invisible, but does make her easy to ignore. She receives a +3 on all Stealth rolls while the Attainment is active. Optional Arcanum: Mind 4 Reading a person’s intentions isn’t difficult; a Sphinx can decipher a target’s basic mood and reactions enough to play off them with the first Attainment of the Legacy. At this advanced stage, however, a tic of the eye or a shift of the hand betrays everything about the target — his hopes, his fears and even his memories. This effect is much like the Mind 4 “Read the Depths” spell (see p. 215 of Mage: The Awakening). The mage must spend at least one turn studying the target before using this Attainment. After that, the player rolls Intelligence + Academics – the subject’s Composure. Unlike Read the Depths, mages with the Mind Arcanum do notget a chance to detect the Attainment’s effect, since it is based entirely on external observation rather than telepathic intrusion. Modifiers for distant memories might apply, but memories or experiences that significantly contributed to the target’s development (such as child abuse or the death of an important figure) might actually grant bonuses, even if the target has repressed them. The third Attainment of the Legacy allows the Sphinx to exert some influence over the world’s meanings. Very few Sphinxes progress to this point, because most of them focus more on discovering what being or phenomenon is responsible for the meaning of the world. Those who do are among the most powerful and inscrutable beings in the World of Darkness, fully in tune with the world’s patterns and able to step outside of those patterns at any time."}]}
