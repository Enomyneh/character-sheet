Sanctums swelled with students, vast libraries of lore were gathered, and expeditions were mounted to the most remote extremities of the globe. Mages journeyed to mist-shrouded mountaintops in legendary lands, deserted isles in uncharted latitudes, lost cities crumbling beneath waves of water, sand or jungle, and into the moldy vaults of rumor-haunted necropolises of antiquity. Some of those who pursued this last course dug too deep into the past and literally awoke the dead. Even the most finely honed Awakened would be sorely pressed to resist the chilling intensity of an undying desire that has festered in darkness and hunger for centuries. These mages found that they had, willingly or not, taken on new instructors, keepers of profound knowledge and wielders of terrifying power, teachers who might have been human once, but were no longer. Masters with a particularly insatiable need. Vampirism is a state of being that comes with fantastic potential, but it is nonetheless a curse. Young vampires do not always grasp the full import of this simple fact, but as the sunless decades of hunger pass, they learn that undying existence is not the same as eternal life. Raging against this fate, an obscure line of vampires called the Tremere encountered an entity from the Abyss and wrested from it certain secrets about the Supernal and Fallen Worlds. Using this forbidden knowledge, they formulated in their blood a way of circumventing their curse by stealing from the living the inner light that they themselves lacked. Through the drinking of blood, a Tremere could tap a victim’s soul, allowing him to live for a short time as if he were nearly human, walking in twilight (but not full daylight) and becoming sated by normal food rather than blood. The process desiccated the stolen soul, however, leaving its owner to wither away into a slow, witless death. The souls of normal humans proved too dim and murky to sustain the Tremere for more than a few days at best. The undead needed something much brighter and clearer. They found what they needed in the Awakened souls of the mages who intruded into their lair, but the very brilliance they desired also ensured that their intended victims were not mere cattle to be seized and consumed with impunity. The mages had to be lured into the fold with intimations of ancient power and arcane lore. The vampires made good on their temptations, unveiling some of the deepest mysteries of vampiric lore. The mages eagerly took the bait, heedless of the cost that would be exacted from them. In tapping the mages’souls while they drank of their blood, the vampires discovered that their Abyssal lore had failed them. The blood burned in their veins with celestial fire and rendered their bodies to ash in mere moments, destroying every single one of them. But their damnation did not end with them. They passed on a part of their curse to their vessels, infecting the mages with the most virulent aspect of their unique Abyssal damnation. The mages, though not undead, had placed one foot firmly on the far side of the grave and found their souls eroding away into the great darkness beyond all light. The spiritual vacuum thus created eventually spread to their outward forms, consuming their bodies until some of them ceased to exist, or else wandered the earth as hungry ghosts. To fill their growing void, the survivors learned to steal the light from those who had it. They had become living vampires, stealers of souls. At first, these sorcerers took the vampires’name, Tremere, as a title to describe their condition: “Tremere-inflicted.”Other mages just called them the Tremere, and over time the lichs accepted this shorthand for themselves, although it is still used as an adjective: “Tremere lich.” A mage must be voluntarily initiated into this Legacy by having his own soul severed by his teacher and replaced with someone else’s. The soul link between instructor and pupil transmits the lich curse once the new soul is attached. Usually, the master then attaches the pupil’s soul to himself, for Awakened souls last much longer than Sleeping souls. It is extremely rare for a young or even middle-aged mage to make this hideous choice. Usually, only those near the end of their natural life spans choose to become lichs in hopes that, by unnaturally extending their lives on a diet of souls, they might unlock the key to ascension and rise to the deathless lands of the Supernal World. And yet, it is possible for a pupil to reverse course and restore his humanity before he has gone too far. If he can regain his own soul and reattach it (using spells, not Tremere attainments) before he raises his Gnosis above the amount of dots he had when he was first initiated into this Legacy, and then if he sacrifices a dot of Willpower, he loses all Tremere attainments and become fully ensouled again. He cannot, however, learn any other Legacy ever again. He cannot engage in soulcraft with a Tremere-touched soul, even though he has overcome the Legacy’s curse. Some have wondered if the vampiric bloodline that damned the mages to lichdom still survives. Although the Tremere mages have searched for any signs of it, they have found none."},{"title":"Appearance","text":"Tremere mages look no different than normal mages. Even Mage Sight cannot reveal their nature, although the Prime Arcanum’s Supernal Vision can. As a Tremere’s soul ages, he tends to gain a distinctive pallor, paleness, shrunkenness and emptiness that, as he begins to lose Willpower (see below), becomes necrotic."},{"title":"Background","text":"Prospective recruits are often targeted according to the talents or resources they can bring to the Tremere. As a consequence, this Legacy tends to manifest in the most affluent and well-educated segment of mage society."},{"title":"Organization","text":"The Tremere is the mostly tightly organized of all the Legacies. Its cabals are small and very secretive. Because of the lichs’predatory nature, the masterstudent relationship within the Tremere is rigid. With the old feeding upon the young and the young feeding upon the “common herd”of humanity, this Legacy somewhat apes the hierarchic structure of vampire society."},{"title":"Suggested Oblations","text":"Practicing utter stillness for an hour without the need of magic and without falling asleep; embalming a corpse; engaging in necrophilia with a corpse; a sincere rite of mourning for someone who has recently died (this could include a stranger, but not someone the mage has killed himself or whose soul he has stolen); digging a grave; carving a headstone"},{"title":"Concepts","text":"Aristocrats, plutocrats, scholars, historians, doctors, tax collectors"}],"attainmentDescription":"Tremere have traded their souls for raw power. Their attainments let them acquire powers normally beyond their abilities for the prerequisites involved, but they trade their own souls in return for these powers. Also, they acquire certain limitations: No Tremere mage can cast the Death 5 “Steal Lifespan”spell (p. 146), even as an improvised casting. That Stygian power is closed to them.","attainments":[{"order":1,"name":"Hideous Stipend","prerequisites":["Gnosis 3","Death 2"],"description":"The mage can steal souls from Sleepers, similar to the Death 3 “Sever the Sleeping Soul”spell (p. 141), although he does not need to spend Mana. An extended action with a Presence + Intimidation + Death roll is required, contested by the victim’s Resolve. See the spell description for complete rules. Unlike normal uses of this spell, this attainment allows a mage to extend his life unnaturally, without any signs of aging (until the soul begins to desiccate; see “Soul Nourishment,”below). Additionally, the user can fashion a soul jar, like the Death 2 “Soul Jar”spell (p. 137), in which to store a soul until it can be attached to him. The process is an extended action that calls for Presence + Crafts + Death rolls, with one roll allowed per hour. Finally, the mage can view the health of a soul before he severs it, similar to the Death 1 “Soul Marks”spell (p. 135). He merely spends an instant action (no roll required) gazing at the subject."},{"order":2,"name":"Wicked Claim","prerequisites":["Gnosis 5","Death 3"],"description":"The mage can bind a stolen soul to himself, similar to the Death 4 “Soul Binding”spell (p. 144). The process is an extended action involving Presence + Empathy + Death rolls, with one roll allowed per hour; see the rules described above for stealing Sleeping souls. Until the mage gains this attainment or learns Death 4, he must rely on another Tremere with this power to attach a soul for him. Additionally, the mage can steal Willpower and/or Mana from injured or dying victims, similar to the Death 3 “Devouring the Slain”spell. An instant action is performed and Manipulation + Intimidation + Death is rolled, subtracting the victim’s Stamina from the dice pool. See the spell’s description for complete effects. Optional Arcanum: Prime 3 If the mage has Prime 3, he can distill a soul into tass instead of attaching it or storing it in a soul jar, similar to the Prime 3 “Create Tass”spell (p. 224). The tass automatically has an amount of Mana equal to its original owner’s Mana (for a mage) or Willpower dots (for a Sleeper). This effect is lasting until the mage chooses to dissolve the tass, sending the soul back into a Twilight state, in which disembodied souls normally exist. Note that souls in tass form can still be affected by any magic that affects souls."},{"order":3,"name":"Supernal Theft","prerequisites":["Gnosis 7","Death 4"],"description":"The mage can now take an Awakened soul, as he did a Sleeper soul with the first attainment. The victim contests with Resolve + Gnosis. In addition, the mage can drain his enemies of their strength, similar to the Death 4 “Enervation”spell (p. 143), with an instant action and a Presence + Occult + Death roll. See the spell description for complete rules."}],"Notes":"The length of time a stolen soul preserves a lich depends on the lich’s age. [[MtAw_Legacy_TremereLich_SoulNourishment]] Once a soul begins to erode, a Tremere loses one Willpower dotper week until his will is gone. With each lost dot, the Tremere’s body takes on increasingly morbid features, becoming necrotic until he resembles a rotting corpse or mummy (although his traits are not affected). Once he has no more Willpower dots, he can no longer regain Willpower points (through a Virtue, Vice or any other means), and he then begins to suffer one aggravated Health wound per week. He cannot heal this damage naturally, and it is Resistant, meaning it cannot be healed supernaturally (see “Resistant Damage,” p. 124). Unless he gets a new soul before he runs out of Health, he perishes completely, with no trace or remnant of his identity left in the Tapestry. Only replacing an eroding soul with a fresh soul stops the decline, and the damage begins to heal naturally. Once the Tremere’s Health is restored, he then begins regaining Willpower dots at a rate of one per week. A mage’s soul is far more valuable than any mere mortal’s. Each Awakened soul can actually reduce a Tremere’s chronological age by one stage on the chart above. Thus, a 100-year-old Tremere requires a human soul each month, but if he can steal the soul of another mage (other than a Tremere), he can go six months without a fresh sacrifice."}
